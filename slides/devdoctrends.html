slide_title: "Trends in Developer Documentation"
slides:

- title: "Scenario: What to say about trends"

- title: Existing current research??!!
  list:
    - Saul Carliner's TC Census
    - Scott Abel's Benchmarking Survey
    - Smartbear's State of API

- title: I'll gather data on my own
  list:
    - Focus only on dev docs
    - Dive into more dev doc concerns
    - 50 questions, 10 minutes
    - See if trends are really different
    - Most interested in tools

- title: Participant statistics (3/9/20)
  list:
    - 806 started
    - 387 completed
    - 313 dropouts
    - 106 terminated via branching

- title: Four main categories
  list_ordered:
    - Tools
    - Processes
    - API
    - Profile

- title: 1. Tools

- title: What is your primary authoring tool for creating documentation?
  level: h3
  image:

- title: What specific tool(s) are you using to create documentation? (freeform)
  level: h3
  paragraph: Confluence 42, Swagger 38, Flare 34, Oxygen 32, Hugo 26, Microsoft Word 25, Jekyll 23, Custom 15, Google Doc 13, ReDoc 13, Framemaker 11, MkDocs 11, Sphinx 11, Gatsby 10, DocuSaurus 7, Postman 7, Readme 7, Epic 6, Paligo 6, Robohelp 6

- title: Reflections
  list:
    - Tools not a single package -- Separate tools for collaboration, text editing, in-code annotations, publishing, management, and deployment
    - JAMstack solutions
    - Among SSGs, only Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby, Sphinx, MkDocs, Docosaurus have much traction for docs
    - Many working in Markdown treat like DITA -- tool irrelevant b/c support comes from so many platforms

- title: If you write content in a text editor, which text editor do you mainly use?
  level: h3
  image:

- title: In general, do you follow a "docs-as-code" approach, where you treat documentation similar to how developers treat code? (e.g., write docs in a text editor, manage with version control, compile using a static site generator, build from the server, etc.)
  level: h3
  image:

- title: What software do you use to create graphics, screenshots, or other visuals?
  level: h3
  image:

  level: h3
  image:
- title: Did you play a significant role in developing/evolving your company's publishing solution (e.g., maybe you helped design the site,  workflows, strategies for content re-use, stylesheets, etc.)?
  level: h3
  image:
- title: How do you manage your content?
  level: h3
  image:
- title: Does your doc publishing solution have continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD)? For example, when you push to a certain branch, do builds kick off on a server and push the docs out to production?
  level: h3
  image:
