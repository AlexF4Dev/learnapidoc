  level: h3
  image: trends-editor.png

- title: What's the most common source format used in your documentation?
  level: h3
  image: trends-most-common-source-format2.png

- title: In general, do you follow a "docs-as-code" approach, where you treat documentation similar to how developers treat code? (e.g., write docs in a text editor, manage with version control, compile using a static site generator, build from the server, etc.)
  level: h3
  image: trends-docs-as-code.png

- title: What software do you use to create graphics, screenshots, or other visuals?
  level: h3
  image: trends-graphics.png

- title: What platform do you use to host and publish documentation, especially to provide continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD)?
  level: h3
  image: trends-cicd.png

- title: Which kind of computer do you use?
  level: h3
  image: trends-mac-pc.png

- title: How do you manage your content?
  level: h3
  image: trends-manage-content.png

- title: "Reflections: Tool categories"
  image: devdoctrends_categoriesoftools.svg

- title: "Reflections: JAMstack solutions"
  list:
    - Many working in Markdown treat it like DITA -- the tool is irrelevant because support for the format comes from so many platforms.
    - No longer a single tool for authoring, review, and publishing. Many different tools are used in different scenarios/purposes. JAMstack solutions.
    - Some people working in dev doc work only in code annotations and OpenAPI specs.

- title: Emerging picture
  list:
    - Writers use Confluence/Word/Google Docs for early content development.
    - They formalize and build docs using a static site generator (Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby, MkDocs) working in Visual Studio Code as the editor.
    - They publish using a docs-as-code model with Git to trigger a CI/CD model publishing on company's own infrastructure.
    - There's also a decent amount of wikis, Oxygen XML, and MadCap Flare use.

## Outputs

- title: <span style="color:yellowgreen">2. Outputs</span>
  level: h2

- title: What's the primary output format for your documentation (which you distribute to your audience)?
  level: h3
  image: trends-primary-output.png

- title: Do you currently create video tutorials or screencasts?
  level: h3
  image: trends-video-screencasts.png

- title: If you aren't creating video/screencasts, why not?
  level: h3
  image: trends-why-no-video2.png

- title: Did you play a significant role in developing/evolving your company's publishing solution (e.g., maybe you helped design the site,  workflows, strategies for content re-use, stylesheets, etc.)?
  level: h3
  image: trends-significant-role.png

- title: Do your docs plug into a larger developer portal? (The developer portal organizes the docs for many different products with unified search, navigation, and other features that bring all the docs together under one roof.)
  level: h3
  image: trends-larger-developer-portal2.png

- title: Do you localize your documentation?
  level: h3
  image: trends-localize2.png

- title: Do you usually generate out PDFs for documentation and distribute them to your audience?
  level: h3
  image: trends-generate-pdfs.png

- title: Emerging picture
  list:
   - Writer primarily create web content that fits into a larger developer portal, which the writer often helps shape and build.
   - Localization, video tutorials, and PDF aren't overwhelmingly produced but do constitute about 1/4 of the output.


- title: <span style="color:yellowgreen">3. Processes</span>
  level: h2

- title: How do you interact with engineering scrum teams?
  level: h3
  image: trends-interact-scrum-teams2.png

- title: How do you review your docs prior to release?
  level: h3
  image: trends-how-review-docs2.png

- title: Does your doc publishing solution have continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD)? For example, when you push to a certain branch, do builds kick off on a server and push the docs out to production?
  level: h3
  image: trends-cicd-to-prod.png

- title: Do you outsource any documentation to an offshore authoring agency?
  level: h3
  image: trends-outsourcing.png

- title: Do you have a style guide for your team that standardizes terminology and conventions regarding style, grammar, and syntax?
  level: h3
  image: trends-style-guide.png

- title: When you collaborate with engineers, how do the engineers contribute?
  level: h3
  image: trends-when-you-collaborate-engineers.png

- title: Emerging picture
  list:
    - Writers participate on scrum teams, sometimes in limited capacity.
    - They review docs using the same tools engineers use to review code.
    - Engineers contribute through pull requests or through wikis.
    - The publishing process is streamlined through CI/CD.
    - Most content is generated within the company rather than outsourced.

## API

- title: <span style="color:yellowgreen">3. API</span>

- title: Does the documentation you work on usually involve some kind of API?
  level: h3
  image: trends-involve-an-api.png

- title: What is the most common type of API you work with?
  level: h3
  image: trends-most-common-api-type.png

- title: If you're creating REST API documentation, do you use the OpenAPI specification?
  level: h3
  image: trends-openapi-spec.png

- title: How do you render the OpenAPI spec into documentation?
  level: h3
  image: trends-how-render-openapi.png

- title: Do you primarily create the OpenAPI spec manually or do you auto-generate it from code annotations?
  level: h3
  image: trends-generating-openapi.png

- title: Who generates out the OpenAPI specification at your company?
  level: h3
  image: trends-who-generates-openapi-spec.png

- title: For reference docs for native library APIs (e.g. Javadoc or Doxygen), who creates this content?
  level: h3
  image: trends-reference-docs.png

- title: What are the most common programming languages you need to know in your role with docs?
  level: h3
  image: trends-common-programming-languages.png

- title: Which of the following new or trending technologies are you documenting (or will likely be documenting) this year?
  level: h3
  image: trends-trending-technologies.png

- title: Emerging Picture
  list:
    - Almost invariably dev docs involves an API, usually a REST API.
    - When documenting the REST API, most use the OpenAPI spec (either creating it manually or auto-generating from code annotations) 
    - Both writers and engineers collaborate as they generate out docs using Swagger UI or a custom parser
    - Native library APIs (e.g. Javadoc) are created by engineer
    - Most important languages to know: JavaScript, Java, and Python
