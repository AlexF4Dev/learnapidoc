resource_description:
  term: Resource description
  def: >
        The resource description describes the information provided by the resource. The description is brief (1-3 sentences) and usually starts with a verb. Resources themselves can have a number of resource URLs to access variations of the same resource, and multiple methods for each resource URL. Thus, you usually have a general resource described and sub-resources also described.

resource_urls:
  term: Resource URLs
  def: >
        The URL paths where the resource can be accessed. The URL shows the end path ("endpoint") only, not the base path common to all endpoints. The same resource usually has a variety of related resource URLs, each with different paths and methods but ultimately returning information about the same resource.

parameters:
  term: Parameters
  def: >
        Options you can use with the endpoint. There are four types of parameters: header parameters, path parameters, query string parameters, and request body parameters.

methods:
  term: Methods
  def: >
        The operations allowed for the resource URL (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and so on).

request_example:
  term: Request example
  def: >
        A sample request for the resource, showing the endpoint and some parameters configured.

response_sample:
  term: Response example
  def: >
        A sample response from a request. The sample response is not comprehensive of all parameter configurations or operations. Also usually contains a table documenting each element in the response.

status_error_codes:
  term: Status and error codes
  def: >
        A code number in the response header that indicates the general status of the response &mdash; for example, whether the request was successful, resulted in an error, was not authorized, and so on. Most status codes (such as 200, 302, 500, etc.) are standard.

code_samples:
  term: Code samples
  def: >
        Sample code snippets for submitting a request to the endpoint using a particular programming language. Code samples are optional and not always included in the reference topics, but are usually welcome and helpful.
