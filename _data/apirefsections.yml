resource_description:
  term: Resource description
  def: >
        The resource description describes the information provided by the resource. The description is brief (1-3 sentences) and usually starts with a verb. Resources themselves can have a number of resource URLs to access variations of the same resource, and multiple methods for each resource URL. Thus, you usually have a general resource described and sub-resources also described.

resource_urls:
  term: Resource URLs and methods
  def: >
        The resource URLs, along with their method (such as GET, POST, or DELETE) indicate how you can interact with the resource. The URL shows the end path ("endpoint") only, not the base path common to all endpoints. The same resource usually has a variety of related resource URLs, each with different paths and methods but ultimately returning information about the same resource.

parameters:
  term: Parameters
  def: >
        Parameters are options you can pass with the resource URL (such as specifying the format or the amount returned) to influence the result. There are four types of parameters: header parameters, path parameters, query string parameters, and request body parameters.

request_example:
  term: Request example
  def: >
        The request example shows a sample request using the resource URL, showing some parameters configured. The request example usually can't show all possible parameter configurations, but it should be as rich as possible with parameters. Sample requests sometimes include code snippets that show the same request in a variety of languages (besides curl). Requests shown in other programming languages are optional and not always included in the reference topics, but when available, users welcome them. 

response_example_and_schema:
  term: Response example and schema
  def: >
        The response example shows a sample response from the request example. The response example is not comprehensive of all parameter configurations or operations, but it should correspond with the parameters passed in the request example. The response lets developers know if the resource contains the information they want, the format, and how that information is structured and labeled. The response schema describes the response in a more comprehensive, general way, listing each property returned, a description of the property, the data format of the property's value, the structure, and other details.
