## <i class="fa fa-user-circle"></i> Activity: Look for common patterns in API doc sites

In this activity, you'll identify common patterns in API documentation sites.

1.  Go the list of about [100 API documentation sites](pubapis_apilist.html#list_api_doc_sites).
2.  Select about 5 different APIs (choose any of those listed on the page).
3.  Look for several patterns or commonalities among the API doc sites. For example, you might look for any of the following patterns:

    * Structure and templates
    * Seamless branding (between docs and the marketing site)
    * Abundant code samples and syntax highlighting
    * Lengthy pages
    * API Interactivity (such as an API Explorer)
    * Docs as code tooling

4.  Note any non-patterns, such as the following:

    * PDF
    * Translation
    * Video tutorials
    * Commenting features
    * Multiple outputs by role

5.  Be prepared to share your findings.
