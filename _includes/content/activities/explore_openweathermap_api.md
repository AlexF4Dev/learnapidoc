### <i class="fa fa-user-circle"></i> Activity: Get familiar with the OpenWeatherMap API

Explore the basic sections in the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api/):

1.  Go to [https://openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org) and click **API** in the top navigation bar.
2.  Explore the information available in the **Current Weather Data** by clicking the **API Doc** button in that section.

    As you explore the site, get a sense of the information this Current Weather Data API provides. The API calls provide developers with ways to pull information into their applications. In other words, the APIs will provide the data plumbing for the applications that developers build.

    Answer the following questions:

    * Does the API provide the information we need about temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and current conditions? (Hint: Look in the sample API response.)
    * How can you specify the location for this information?
    * What does a sample request look like?
    * How many endpoints does the API have?
    * What's required to access the information?
