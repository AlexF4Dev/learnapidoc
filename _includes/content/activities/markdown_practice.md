To get a sense of how Markdown works, lets practice a bit with Markdown.

1.  Go to an online Markdown editor (such as [Dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/)).
2.  Create the following:

    * Numbered list
    * Bulleted list
    * Word with bold formatting
    * Code sample
    * Level 2 heading
    * code formatted text
