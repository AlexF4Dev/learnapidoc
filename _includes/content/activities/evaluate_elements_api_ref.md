## <i class="fa fa-user-circle"></i> Evaluate API reference docs for core elements

In this activity, you'll review API reference documentation and identify the common elements that we covered in this section.

To critique an API reference topic:

1.  From this [list of about 100 API doc sites here](pubapis_apilist.html), identify three API documentation sites.
2.  In each of the doc sites, look for the API reference documentation section.
3.  In the reference documentation, identify each of the sections:

    *  [Resource description](docapis_resource_descriptions.html)
    *  [Endpoints and methods](docapis_resource_endpoints.html)
    *  [Parameters](docapis_doc_parameters.html)
    *  [Request example](docapis_doc_sample_requests.html)
    *  [Response example and schema](docapis_doc_sample_responses_and_schema.html)

    (The section names may differ in the API doc sites you find, but they're usually recognizable.)

3.  Assess the API reference documentation by answering the following questions for each element:

    **Resource description:**
      *  Is the description action-oriented?
      *  Is it a brief 1-3 sentence summary?

    **Endpoints and methods:**
      *  How are the endpoints grouped? (Are they listed all on the same page, or on different pages? Are they grouped by method, or by resource?)
      *  Are they called "endpoints" or something else?

    **Parameters:**
      *  How many types of parameters are there (header, path, query string, and request body parameters) for the endpoints?
      *  Are the data types (string, boolean, etc.) defined for each parameter?

    **Request example:**
      *  In what format or language is the request shown (e.g. curl, specific languages, other)?
      *  How many parameters does the sample request include?

    **Response example:**
      *  Is there both a sample response *and* a response schema? (And is each element in the response actually defined?)
      *  How does the doc site handle nested hierarchies in the response?
