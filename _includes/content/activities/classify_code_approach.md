{% if page.permalink == "/workshop.html" %}{:.no_toc}{% endif %}

Find a code tutorial within one of the API documentation sites you've been exploring. Or look at one of the API doc sites in this post by Nordic APIs on [5 Examples of Excellent API Documentation (and Why We Think So)](https://nordicapis.com/5-examples-of-excellent-api-documentation/). This post lists five API doc sets: [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api), [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation), [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/getting-started/), and [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview).

Find a code tutorial in the documentation. Figure out which approach the code documentation best aligns with.
