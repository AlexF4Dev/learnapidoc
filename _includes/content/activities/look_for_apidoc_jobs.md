## <i class="fa fa-user-circle"></i> Activity 9a: Look at API documentation jobs and requirements
{% if page.permalink == "/workshop.html" %}{:.no_toc}{% endif %}

In this activity, you'll get a sense of the skills needed for the jobs in your location, and then draw up a plan.

1.  Go to [indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/).
2.  In the **Where** field, type your desired location.
3.  Search for "API technical writer" or some combination of API + technical writer + developer documentation jobs.
4.  Read the descriptions of 5 jobs.
5.  Note a few of the salient requirements for these jobs.
6.  Assess where you're currently at with the following:
    *  Portfolio with writing samples that include developer documentation
    *  Technical knowledge related to developer domain
    *  Experience writing developer documentation
7.  Make a plan for how you'll match up your portfolio, tech knowledge, and experience related to what these job descriptions are asking for. You might need to dedicate more time to an [open-source documentation project](docapis_find_open_source_project.html) to build up the needed skills.
