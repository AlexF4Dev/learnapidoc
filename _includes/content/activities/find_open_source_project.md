To find an open-source project with API doc needs:

1.  Go to the [GitHub Advanced Search](https://github.com/search/advanced).
2.  In the "With the labels" section, type `help wanted`. This is a common tag teams use to attract volunteers to their project (but some teams that need help might not use it).
3.  Scroll to the top and notice that `label: "help wanted"` automatically populates in the field. In this Advanced Search box at the top, add some additional keywords (such as `documentation` and `api`) as well:

   <a class="noCrossRef" href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=documentation+api+label%3A%22help+wanted%22&type=Issues&ref=advsearch&l=&l="><img src="images/githubopensourceprojects.png"/></a>

4.  Click **Search** and browse [the results](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=documentation+api+label%3A%22help+wanted%22&type=Issues&ref=advsearch&l=&l=).

    Are there any projects that look promising? If so, great. If not, adjust some of the keywords and keep looking.

5.  If searching GitHub doesn't yield any appropriate projects, try the following resources:

    * [Trending GitHub projects](https://github.com/trending)
    * [Crowdforge](https://crowdforge.io/)
    * [Up for Grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/#/)
    * [Bus Factor](https://libraries.io/experiments/bus-factor)
    * [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
    * [Changelog](https://changelog.com/)
    * [24-hour Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com)
    * [Programmableweb.com API directory](https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis)

    Programmableweb.com has the largest index of API documentation projects. Many of the projects may not need documentation nor provide open-source GitHub projects for working on the documentation. However, with an index of nearly 20,000 APIs, you might be able to find a project that might align with your interests, background, and other needs.

    {% include note.html content="You could spend a long time evaluating and deciding on open source projects. For this activity, it's okay if you focus on a project that looks sort of interesting. You don't need to commit to it. You can always change it later." %}

6.  After selecting a project, make notes on the following:

    *  Does the project involve a REST API?
    *  How does the project tag documentation related issues? For example, does it use the "documentation" label?
    *  Identify the current state of the project's documentation. Are the docs robust, skimpy, nonexistent, etc.?
    *  Assuming the project includes a REST API, do the API reference topics include the common elements covered in this course ([Resource description](docapis_resource_descriptions.html), [Endpoints and methods](docapis_resource_endpoints.html), [Parameters](docapis_doc_parameters.html), [Request example](docapis_doc_sample_requests.html), [Response example and schema](docapis_doc_sample_responses_and_schema.html))?
