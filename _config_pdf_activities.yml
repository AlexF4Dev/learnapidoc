subparagraph: "This booklet contains a PDF of the activities listed in <b>https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/workshop.html</b> in print format. As you're working through the workshop activities, you might find it easier to have the instructions printed out next to your laptop rather than toggling between screens and windows."
