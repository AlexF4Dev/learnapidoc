In December 2014, I published a survey to gather some basic information about API documentation practices. I used an informal, short-answer style with 10 questions listed in a [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FYjPsjOcUws7vsJ_IV1G7huauiOT5cS1GmZqVBOf2lQ/). About 43 people participated, though not everyone responded to every question.

If I were doing this survey again, I would clarify some of my questions. Still, the responses were valuable and paint a good picture of how API tech writers author and produce content.

Here are the 10 questions. With each question, I expound a bit on the responses and implications.

* [What type of API do you document?](survey_most_popular_apis_to_document.html)
* [What programming languages are you most familiar with?](survey_most_common_programming_languages.html)
* [What authoring tool/syntax do you use?](survey_preferred_authoring_tools.html)
* [Do you create API doc by looking at source code?](survey_creation_from_source_code.html)
* [Do you test out the API calls used in your doc yourself?](survey_test_api_calls_yourself.html)
* [What IDE do you use?](survey_preferred_ides.html)
* [Are API docs auto-rendered through build process?](survey_automating_api_docs.html)
* [How do you get the source files that contain code comments?](survey_access_to_code.html)
* [How to learn what you need to know?](survey_learn_what_you_need.html)
* [What aspect of API doc do you find most challenging?](survey_most_challenging_aspect.html)
* [Do engineers write API doc in the source code?](survey_engineers_write_in_source.html)
* [How much of your doc process is automated?](survey_how_much_automation.html)
