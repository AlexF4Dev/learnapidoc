It's pretty common for developers to add Javadoc tags and brief comments as they're creating Java code. In fact, if they don't add it, the IDE will usually produce a warning error.

However, the comments that developers add are usually poor, incomplete, or incomprehensible. A tech writer's job with Javadoc is often to edit the content that's already there, providing more clarity, structure, inserting the right tags, and more.

## What to look for when editing Javadoc content

{% include random_ad2.html %}

When you make edits to Javadoc content, look for the following:

* **Missing doc**. Lots of Javadoc is incomplete. Look for missing documentation.
* **Consistent style**. See if the existing tags follow Java's style conventions.
* **Clarity**. Some descriptions are unintelligible due to the curse of knowledge, but it's hard to judge without a stronger grasp of Java.

{% include random_ad.html %}

{% include activity.html %}

Make some edits to a class and method. Then regenerate the Javadoc and find your changes. See how they get rendered in the output.
