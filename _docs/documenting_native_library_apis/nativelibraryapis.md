Native library APIs refer to Java, C++, or other programming specific APIs. In this model, rather than making requests across the web for the information, you download a library of code an integrate it into your project. The library is compiled into your application's build. Although this type of API is less common, I include it here in part to clarify what makes REST (or web) APIs so different.
