Testing your documentation is critical to providing accurate, thorough information. With API and developer docs, due to the high level of complexity and engineering requirements, technical writers might be inclined to simply take information that engineers give them and incorporate them wholesale, without personally testing them. This can reduce your role to being an engineer's secretary.
