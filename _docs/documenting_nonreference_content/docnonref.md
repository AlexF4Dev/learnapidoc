While reference topics in API generally receive the most attention, the non-reference topics, such as getting started tutorials, information about authorization, rate limiting, status and error codes, quick reference guides, and more constitute about half the documentation. These topics are usually handled more by technical writers than engineers. You can evaluate documentation by looking to see whether it includes these non-reference topics.
