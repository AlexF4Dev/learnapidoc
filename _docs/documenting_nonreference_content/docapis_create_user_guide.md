Up until this point, we've mostly been focusing on the [reference aspects of API documentation](docendpoints.html) (the endpoints). The reference documentation is only one aspect of API documentation. In this section, I'll cover the main non-reference topics that are commonly found in API documentation. Rather than "non-reference topics," you might consider this type of information the "user guide."

## Common topics in the user guide

The following are non-reference topics commonly found in API documentation:

* [API Overview](docapis_doc_overview.html)
* [Getting started tutorial](docapis_doc_getting_started_section.html)
* [Authentication and authorization requirements](docapis_more_about_authorization.html)
* [Status and error codes](docapis_doc_status_codes.html)
* [Rate limiting and thresholds](docapis_rate_limiting_and_thresholds.html)
* [Code samples/tutorials](docapis_codesamples_bestpractices.html)
* [SDKs and sample apps](docapis_sdks_and_sample_apps.html)
* [Quick reference guide](docapis_doc_quick_reference.html)
* [API best practices](docapis_best_practices_with_api.html)
* [Glossary](docapis_glossary_section.html)

I'll provide general descriptions and overviews of what these sections contain, following by examples from actual API documentation sites.

Beyond the sections outlined above, you might want to include other tasks and tutorials specific to your API, based on what you expect your users to do and the business scenarios for which they'll use your API.
