Unlike the activities in earlier sections, it's harder to practice a skill related to non-reference content. For this activity, instead of exploring a particular tool or technique, you'll analyze content from some doc sites. Why? Sometimes the best way to learn how to create API documentation is to carefully observe how it's done on sites you admire. Following common practices in the industry helps you create more predictable, easy-to-follow patterns in your own documentation.
