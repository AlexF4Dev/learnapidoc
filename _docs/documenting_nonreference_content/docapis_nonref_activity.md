With each of the non-reference topics in this section, you've been analyzing the topic in the context of the [open-source project you identified](docapis_find_open_source_project.html). Now broaden your analysis to see how these non-reference topics appear in other API documentation sites. Remember that sometimes the best way to learn how to create API documentation is to carefully observe how it's done on sites you admire. Following common practices in the industry helps you create more predictable, easy-to-follow patterns in your own documentation.
