> At my company, we publish end-user content in the form of training, wikis, product documentation, help, and marketing content. All of this content is coming from different teams and from different tools. There really is no easy way to know how much content there is, if it's outdated, if it needs review soon, who the best SMEs/stakeholders are for each piece of content and how to communicate with them, how to report content data to others, etc.

Have you seen a similar challenge in your career? If so, how have you resolved it?

Do you know of any tools out there that directly help with this kind of issue?
