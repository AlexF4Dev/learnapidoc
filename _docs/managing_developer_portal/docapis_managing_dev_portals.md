The process for managing developer portal documentation includes a number of different workflows for different types of documentation. This section outlines potential workflows in granular detail for the following:

* [Managing documentation projects](docapis_process_for_managing_doc_projects.html)
* Managing small documentation requests
* Managing SDK releases
* Git workflows
* Deprecating content

I'm currently building this section out and will be adding more links here as I create the content. I expect to finish this section by September 2020.
