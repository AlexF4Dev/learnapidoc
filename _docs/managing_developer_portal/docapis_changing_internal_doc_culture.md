One of the most dominating elements that will largely determine your experience as a technical writer is the documentation culture. If you find yourself in an organization with a poor documentation culture, it can be difficult if not impossible to change. Poor documentation culture/environments lead to high turnover, loss of motivation for existing employees, and contributes to a downward spiral of tasks you can never quite get a handle on.

## What is a poor documentation environment?

Poor documentation environments can be characterized by any of the following:

* **Lack of executive sponsorship or support**. No one at the executive level is a strong believer in docs. They might give lip service to the importance of docs but then fail to adequately staff resources, not only resources for writers but also for the tools infrastructure and any supporting engineers. Docs rarely bubble up to their radar, and tech writers are invisible to them.

* **Lack of integration in formal processes**. Engineering processes that don't require documentation as part of the "definition of done," or which don't include documentation as any requirement for product development and release, can also devalue the tech writer role. Documentation requests might come in at the last minute, when the features are fully coded and ready for release in a few days &mdash; they just lack some documentation, which probably can't be written in the given timeframe.

* **Lack of enough human resources for the required work.** You might always feel short-handed and unable to ramp up on the needed work. You might move from project to project in a cursory way, never able to adequately ramp up on the technology to become a SME or more experienced user. If you already have a poor doc culture/environment, you might have high turnover and be constantly trying to fill open positions. As soon as someone arrives another leaves, and you end up doing more work than your role alone.

* **Check box mentality is common.** If product and department leaders see documentation as simply a box to check off and nothing more, look out, especially if that box has no standards of minimum bar associated with it. This "check box mentality" shows little interest in the actual user experience. As soon as the docs are done, they're crossed off the list and rarely revisited. People who care about docs might think about the different facets of docs on a deeper level.

* **Support for tooling is underfunded for the requirements.** You might need robust tools to provide the kind of experience people expect, but the company might not want to fund any tooling resources, insisting that you use open-source tools instead but also not providing enough time to build out the theme and other integrations for the open-source tools.

Most tech writers are familiar with these aspects. I've written about these topics multiple times on my blog in these two series:

* [Reflecting seven years later about why we were laid off](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/reflecting-seven-years-later-about-layoff-intro/)
* [Value arguments for docs and tech comm](https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/12/28/value-of-tech-comm-in-company-part1/)

## Can culture be changed?

Without sounding like too much of a pessimist, I don't think a company's documentation culture and environment can be changed easily, if much at all. Unless your company has a business reason that heavily depends on the customer experience (and they recognize this), this might be an uphill battle. Although I'll give some approaches to changing culture in the next section, I have to be fully honest here and admit that, changing culture is extremely difficult, requires a tremendous amount of work, and it's not something I have been all that successful with. Nevertheless, I'll still share my thoughts and insights about how culture could potentially be changed.

## 5 steps to changing doc culture

1.  **Become visible.** The first step to influencing change is to become visible. As one of the most visible tech comm bloggers on the planet, I know how to become visible to those around me. The recipe is simple: write relevant content and share it with those around you &mdash; *over and over and over*. In the context of documentation teams, you don't need to write blog posts. Instead, make a list of all your recent updates each month, and then send it out to as many relevant stakeholders as you can. This will help them see on a regular basis what your team is creating. They'll come to understand who you are, what kind of content you create, and when the topic of documentation comes up, you'll be first on their mind.

2.  **Attend engineering scrum/kanban meetings with engineers.**  My best experiences have been when I'm integrated closely with engineering teams, attending their daily standups, sprint demos, and other scrum/kanban meetings. Organizational setups and distributions don't always allow for this type of integration, but hands-down, whenever I've done this, it has absolutely changed my experience with the product team in extremely positive ways. It doesn't really work to attend more than a couple of these meetings, but consider maybe attending 1-2 standups a day, rotating to different engineering teams depending on what you support. Even if you just drop in once a week, to a different team each day, this will dramatically change your visibility and experience with the teams. Usually, teams don't have so much doc work that they need you there daily (and if you do attend the same team's standup on a daily basis, you might actually feel it's a waste of time), so a once or twice a week drop-in might be ideal and build the needed rapport.

2.  **Relay customer insights.** One of the most valuable assets at a company is deep customer knowledge. If you can communicate customer insights into internal product teams, this raises your value and relevance. Add a [feedback form](docapis_collecting_feedback_post_release.html) at the bottom of each of your doc pages. At a monthly basis, review all the feedback and send it out to product teams and other stakeholders. Include other metrics about the most popular pages and trending search results. People love this kind of customer insight. If you want to take it a step further, share a competitive analysis about the customer experience on other tools or services, highlighting how your company compares.

3.  **Create metrics that communicate relevance.** Almost every team need to report metrics about what you create. Even though metrics are nearly impossible with docs, find some metrics that seem to matter, and report them as if they are meaningful. Some ideas here might be the following:

* The number of incoming tickets versus resolved tickets (e.g., we received 12 tickets this month and resolved 9 of them)
*

4.  **Market your group.**

5.  **Avoid creating tools yourself so that you can optimize your focus on the content.**
