When I give API workshops, it helps to consolidate activities into a single page with brief instructions. The content for the activities below is the same content that appears in other parts of the course &mdash; it's just pulled in here for convenience.

Because completing the activities is an essential part of learning, I've tried to incorporate as many hands-on learning activities as possible, making them both practical and useful. If you have feedback about how to improve the activities, or places where you keep getting stuck, [let me know](contact.html).

Some people have asked me whether a certificate is available for completing all of the activities in the course. Currently, no certificate is available. However, I'm currently investigating the best approach for doing this.
