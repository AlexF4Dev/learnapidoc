Hi, I'm Tom Johnson, a technical writer in the San Francisco Bay area. I work at [Amazon Lab126](http://www.lab126.com/), which builds the devices for many of Amazon's products (such as the Kindle, Echo, Fire TV, and more). Here's the story of how I got into API documentation.

Like most technical writers, I stumbled into technical writing after working in other fields. After earning a BA in English and an MFA in nonfiction creative writing, I started out my career as a writing teacher. Realizing that teaching wasn't my calling, I transitioned into marketing copywriting, and then turned to technical writing to survive financially.

Despite my initial resistance to the idea of technical writing, I found that I actually liked technical writing â€” a lot more than copywriting. Technical writing combined my love for writing with my fascination for technology. I worked as a traditional technical writer for a number of years, mostly documenting applications with user interfaces until one day, my organization laid off the tech writing team.

I decided to steer my career into a tech writing market that was more in demand: developer documentation, particularly API documentation. I also moved into the mecca of tech: Silicon Valley, which is the San Francisco Bay area of California.

I started documenting my first API at a gamification startup, and then transitioned to another semi-startup to continue with more API documentation. I was no longer working with applications that has user interfaces, and the audiences for my docs were primarily developers. It was a new landscape to navigate, with different tools, expectations, goals, and deliverables.

Although I don't have a programming background, I've always been somewhat technical. As a teacher I created my own interactive website. As a traditional tech writer, I often set up or hacked the authoring tools and outputs. I like learning and experimenting with new technologies. As such, the developer documentation landscape suits me well, and I enjoy it.

Still, I'm by no means a programmer nor do I possess deep technical skills. As a technical writer, these skills are helpful but not essential. What matters most is your ability to learn something new, even if it's challenging at first. And then to articulate your knowledge in easy-to-consume ways.

If you have a question for me, or just want to drop me a line, send your feedback to the e-mail address below.
