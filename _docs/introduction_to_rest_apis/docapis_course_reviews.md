> Tom, this course is great. I'm only part way through it, but it already helped me get a job by appearing fluent in APIs during an interview. Thanks for doing this. I can't imagine how many volunteer hours you've put into helping the technical communication community here. [Link](/learnapidoc/index.html#comment-3124829110)

> I love this course (I may have already posted that)â€”it's the best resource I have come across, explained in terms I understand. I've used it as a basis for my style guide and my API documentation.... [Helen Griffith](https://disqus.com/by/helengriffith/)

> Hi Tom, I went through the whole course. Its highly valuable and I learned a bunch of things that I am already applying to real world documentation projects. ...  I think for sure the most valuable thing about your course is the clear step by step procedural stuff that gives the reader hands-on examples to follow (its so great to follow a course by an actual tech. writer!)
