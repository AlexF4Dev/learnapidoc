what have you learned?
1.  repo size large or small.
2.  how many authors.
3.  how do they share content.
4.  what methods are available to you in git
5.  building from the server
6.  manage links from one doc set to another
7.  submodules versus subtrees versus bundler
8.  empowering engineering teams to author
9.  keeping it simple versus satisfying complex requirements
10. centralizing theme files
11. inserting content into larger website template

what similarities exist in the programming world?
- common library that others pull into their projects
- plugins and themes distributed in wordpress
- jekyll method for distributing code
- we often think we're ahead of the curve b/c of how we share content with structured authoring, but programmers have been doing this for a while.
- git provides tremendous flexibility for sharing code. this is one of the main reasons to move to static site generators.

what's the biggest problem you run into?
- sharing content
- adjusting your tools to fit developer requirements
- working with developers. writers often have their own tools separate from developers tools. you can now talk to each other, you can integrate into larger workflows. this is one of the major benefits and promises of moving to developer docs. plug into an existing worklow for your site.
-working in agile. you don't know all requirements up front until you actually do stuff.
