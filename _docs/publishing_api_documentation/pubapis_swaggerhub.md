- public, private sharing of API
- work as a team
- common that tech writer will work with engineers on this. not a one man job. but how do you collaborate?
- versions. you can have a published version while also developing a new version. this makes experimentation sfae and easy.
- comments
- export out client sdks
- paid and free accounts
- reuse content thru domains. a single point of access to all of your definitions.
prototype, collaborate, test, and iterate.
prototype and generate your client sdk's from your swagger definition before even coding anything.
- control permissions for collaborators
- swaggerhub is an ide for designing swagger. everyting integrated into one hub.

 It integrates the core Swagger tools (UI, Editor, CodeGen, Validator) into a single platform to help you coordinate the entire workflow of an APIâ€™s lifecycle.
