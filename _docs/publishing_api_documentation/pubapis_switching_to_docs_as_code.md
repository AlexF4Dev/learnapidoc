- changing tools can be quite difficult
- large companies have homegrown processes and tools.
- need a tool that is flexible enough to adapt its output into this larger process.
- if you're a little shop, you may not want to create all of this tooling yourself. for example, you may be biting off more than you can chew. search, UI design, etc. can be challenging.
- finding a tool that can scale is huge. how exactly do you scale?
- supporting translation is also tricky
- how is working in a large org different? you already have some pieces in place: gitfarm, a build server with pipelines, a media CDN, an A/B testing tool, different environments, engineers supporting these sites
- most difficult is i have a do it all myself attitude and don't like to wait on other teams. i can do things in a few weeks where it can take months waiting on another team. i dislike abdicating control.
- the supporting engineers don't understand our doc requirements, processes, and needs, and we don't understand server workflows and their processes. what they implement seems considerably more difficult.
- you're integrating your doc into a larger site with existing processes. the larger site has marketing material.
- you have lots of other writers who are interacting in this process. you're not just acting alone.
- you probably have to account for translation.
- you don't want to have doc as a separate, indepent output different from the rest of the site.
