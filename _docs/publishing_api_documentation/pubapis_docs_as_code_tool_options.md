In the developer documentation space, there are many different tools for creating documentation, and thereâ€™s no clear industry standard. Different tools may better suit different environments, skill sets, products, and requirements. On this page, I've listed the most common authoring tools related to the developer documentation space.

I've sorted these tools into three main groups: static site generators, hosting and deployment options, and static CMS platforms. You use static site generators to author content, and hosting and deployment options to build and deploy the content. Some solutions combine the two &mdash; these I call static CMS platforms.

Note that the tools below are useful for writing and deploying documentation, particularly the [non-reference content](docnonref.html) in your project. For tools that will read an [OpenAPI specification document](pubapis_swagger_intro.html) and generate interactive reference documentation, see [Other tools to parse and display OpenAPI specs](pubapis_other_openapi_parsers.html).

Also, as explained in [Docs-as-code tools](pubapis_docs_as_code.html), I'm primarily focusing on static site generators and hosting/deployment options rather than traditional help authoring tools (HATs).

## Static site generators

### What are static site generators?

Static site generators (view a full list at [Staticgen.com](https://www.staticgen.com/)) are applications that run on the command line and compile a website. For example, you might have various files defining a layout, some "include" files, a configuration file, and your content files. The static site generator reads your configuration file and pushes your content into the layout files, adds whatever includes are referenced (such as a sidebar or footer), and writes out the HTML pages from the Markdown sources. Each page usually has the sidebar and other navigation included directly into it, as well as all the other layout code you've defined, ready for viewing.

With a regular content management system (CMS) like WordPress, content is actually stored in a separate database and dynamically pulled from the database to the web page on each user visit. Static site generators don't have databases &mdash; all the content is on the page already, and nothing is dynamically assembled on the fly through PHP or other server-side scripting. The entire website is fully built when the user arrives; nothing changes dynamically based on the user's profile (unless done with client-side JS).

With static site generators, when you're developing content on your local machine, you're usually given a web server preview (such as `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`). Many static site generators rebuild your site continuously in the browser preview server each time you make a change. The time to rebuild your site could take less than a second or, if you have thousands of pages, several minutes.

Because everything is compiled locally, you don't need to worry about security hacks into a database. Everything is a human-readable plain text file. It's also incredibly easy to work with custom code, such as special JavaScript libraries or advanced HTML or other complex code you want to use on a page. You can author your content in Markdown or HTML, add code samples inside code blocks that are processed with a code-syntax highlighter, and more. It's simply much easier and more flexible to do what you want.

Most static site generators allow you to use a templating and scripting languages inside your content. You can use if-else statements, run loops, insert variables, and do a lot more sophisticated processing of your content through this templating language directly on your page.

Because you're working with text files, you usually store your project files (but not the built site output) in a code repository such as GitHub. You treat your content files with the same workflow as programming code &mdash; committing to the repository, pushing and pulling for updates, branching and merging, and more.

When you're ready to publish your site, you can usually build the site directly from your Git repository (rather than building it locally and then uploading the files to a web server). This means your code repository becomes your publishing host. "Continuous delivery," as it's called, eliminates the need to manually build your site and deploy the build. Instead, you just push a commit to your repository, and the continuous delivery platform builds and deploys it for you.

Although there are hundreds of static site generators, only a handful of are probably relevant for documentation. I'll consider these three in this article:

* [Jekyll](#jekyll)
* [Hugo](#hugo)
* [Sphinx](#sphinx)

One could discuss many more &mdash; Hexo, Middleman, Gitbook, Pelican, and so on. But the reality is that these other static site generators aren't used that frequently for documentation projects.

### Jekyll {#jekyll}

I devote an entire topic to [Jekyll](pubapis_jekyll.html), complete with example Git workflows, so I won't go as deep in detail here. Jekyll is a Ruby-based static site generator originally built by the co-founder of GitHub. Jekyll builds your website by converting Markdown to HTML, inserting pages into layouts you define, running any Liquid scripting and logic, compressing styles, and writing the output to a \_site folder that that you can deploy on a web server.

There are several compelling reasons to use Jekyll:

* **Large community**. The community, arguably the largest among static site generator communities, includes web developers, not just documentation-oriented groups. This broader focus attracts more developer attention and helps propel greater usage.
* **Control.** Jekyll provides a lot of powerful features (often through Liquid, a scripting language) that allow you to do almost anything with the platform. Because of this, you probably won't outgrow it. Jekyll will match whatever web development skills or other JS, HTML, or CSS frameworks you want to use with it. Even without a development background, it's fairly easy to figure out and code the scripts you need. (See my series [Jekyll versus DITA](http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/03/23/new-series-jekyll-versus-dita/) for details on how to do in Jekyll what you're probably used to doing in DITA.)
* **Integration with GitHub and AWS S3.** Tightly coupling Jekyll with the most used version control repository on the planet (GitHub) almost guarantees its success. The more GitHub is used, the more Jekyll is also used, and vice versa. [GitHub Pages](#github_pages) will auto-build your Jekyll site ("continuous delivery"), allowing you to automate the publishing workflow without effort.

If GitHub isn't appropriate for your project, you can also publish to AWS S3 bucket using the [s3_website plugin](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website), which syncs your Jekyll output with an S3 bucket by only adding or removing the files that changed.

For [theming](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/), Jekyll offers the ability to package your theme as a Rubygem and then distribute it across multiple themes. Rubygems is a package manager, which means it's a repository for plugins. You pull the latest gems (plugins) you need from Rubygems through the command line, often using Bundler. Distributing your theme as a Rubygem is one approach you could use for breaking up your project into smaller projects to ensure faster build times.

You can use [Liquid scripting](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/) for implementing more advanced logic in your themes. This gives you an incredible amount of control to abstract complex code from users through simple templates and layouts.

### Hugo

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a static site generator that is rapidly growing in popularity. Based on the Go language, Hugo builds your site faster than most other static site generators, including Jekyll. There's an impressive number of [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/), including some designed for [documentation](https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/documentation/). Specifically, see the [Learn theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-theme-learn/en) and this [multilingual API documentation theme](https://github.com/bep/docuapi).

As with Jekyll, Hugo allows you to write in Markdown, add frontmatter content in YAML (or TOML or JSON) at the top of your Markdown pages, and more.

Hugo has a robust and flexible templating language (Golang) that makes it appealing to designers, who can build more sophisticated websites based on the depth of the platform (see [Hugo's docs here](https://gohugo.io/documentation/)). But the main selling point behind Hugo is that it builds your site fast.

### Comparing speed with Hugo with Jekyll

{: .note}
Speed here refers to the time to compile your web output, not the time your site takes to load when visitors view the content in a browser.

Speed may not be immediately apparent when you first start evaluating static site generators. You probably won't realize how important speed is until you have thousands of pages in your site and are waiting for it to build.

Although it depends on how you've coded your site (e.g., the number of for loops that iterate through pages), in general, I've noticed that with Jekyll projects, if you have, say, 1,000 pages in your project, it might take about a minute or two to build the site. Thus, if you have 5,000 pages, you could be waiting 5 minutes or more for the site to build. The whole automatic re-building feature becomes almost irrelevant, and it can be difficult to identify formatting or other errors until the build finishes.

If Hugo can build a site much, much faster, it offers a serious advantage in the choice of static site generators. Given that major web development sites like [Smashing Magazine chose Hugo](https://next.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/a-little-surprise-is-waiting-for-you-here/), this is evidence of Hugo's emerging superiority among the static site generators.

For a detailed comparison of Hugo versus Jekyll, see [Hugo vs. Jekyll: Comparing the leading static website generators](https://opensource.com/article/17/5/hugo-vs-jekyll). In one of the comments, a reader says:

> I have been doing extended research on this topic and in the end chose to use Jekyll. I have done a huge project: [https://docs.mendix.com](https://docs.mendix.com), where we have made the complete website Open Source on Github.
>
> Fun project where I ended up moving quite some stuff from Jekyll to Node. For example generating Sitemaps tended to be faster when doing it in Node instead of Jekyll.
>
> Bit... Here's the downside. Our documentation is about 2700 pages (I'll have to lookup the real number). Generating the whole site takes about 90 seconds. That's kind of annoying when you're iterating over small changes. I did a basic test in Hugo, it does it in about 500ms.
>
> So if I am able to transfer the work that's done by plugins to Hugo/Node, I am going to refactor this to Hugo, because of the speed.
>
> I might end up writing a similar blog about this project, it's long overdue.

Generating a 2,700 page document site in Jekyll took 90 seconds; with Hugo, it took 0.5 seconds. This is a serious speed advantage that will allow you to scale your documentation site in robust ways. The author (whose docs are here: [https://docs.mendix.com](https://docs.mendix.com)) did later make the switch from Jekyll to Hugo (see the [doc overview in GitHub](https://github.com/mendix/docs)). This suggests that speed is perhaps a primary characteristic to evaluate in static site generators.

The deliberation between Hugo and Jekyll will require you to think about project size &mdash; how big should your site be? Should you have one giant site, with content for all documentation/products stored in the same repo? Or should you have multiple smaller repos? These are some of the considerations I wrestled with when [implementing docs-as-code tooling](pubapis_switching_to_docs_as_code.html). I concluded that having a single, massive project is superior because it allows easier content re-use, onboarding, validation and error checking, deployment management, and more.

If starting from scratch, I might use Hugo instead of Jekyll. However, I have a lot of custom scripting in Jekyll already (such as the ability to generate Kindle books and PDF), not to mention a publishing pipeline with Jekyll already integrated. However, given that content is largely in the same format (Markdown with YAML frontmatter), switching between the two platforms shouldn't be too difficult (thought admittedly, I haven't tried it).

Also, there are workarounds in Jekyll to enabling faster builds. In my doc projects at work (where we have probably 1,500 pages or so across many different doc sets), we implemented build shortcuts. By cascading configuration files, we can limit the builds to one particular doc directory. I have one configuration file (e.g., \_config.yml, the default) that sets all content as `publish: true`, and another configuration file (e.g., config-acme.yml) that sets all content as `publish: false` except for a particular doc directory (the one I'm working with, e.g., acme). When I'm working with that acme doc directory, I build Jekyll like this:

```
jekeyll serve --config _config.yml,config-acme.yml
```

The `config-acme.yml` will overwrite the default `_config.yml` to enable one specific doc directory as `publish: true` while disabling all others. As a result, Jekyll builds lightning fast. This method tends to work quite well and is used by others with large Jekyll projects as well. We have continuous delivery configured with the server, so when it's time to push out the full build (where `publish: true` is applied to all directories and no config-acme.yml file is used), that full build process takes place on the server, not the local machine.

Although static site generators seem to change quickly, it's harder for one tool, like Hugo, to overtake another, like Jekyll, because of the custom coding developers usually do with the platform. If you're just using someone's theme with general Markdown pages, great, switching will be easy. But if you've built custom layouts and added custom frontmatter in your Markdown pages that gets processed in unique ways by the layouts, as well as other custom scripts or code that you created in your theme specifically for your content, changing platforms will be more challenging. You'll have to change all your custom Liquid scripting to Golang. Or if working with another platform, you might need to change your Golang scripts to Jinja templating, and so forth.

For this reason, you don't just jump from one platform to the next (as you might do with DITA projects, where you don't often usually their own output tools, and where the content follows the same standard.)

### Sphinx {#sphinx}

[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) is a popular static site generator based on Python. It was originally developed by the Python community to document the Python programming language (and it has some direct capability to document Python classes), but Sphinx is also used for many documentation projects unrelated to Python.

Because Sphinx was designed from the ground up as a documentation tool, not just as tool for building websites (like Jekyll and Hugo were), Sphinx has more documentation-specific functionality that is often absent from other static site generator tools. Some of these documentation-specific features include robust search, more advanced linking (linking to sections, automating titles based on links, cross-references, and more), and use of reStructuredText (rST), which is more semantically rich, standard, and extensible than Markdown. (See [What about reStructuredText and Asciidoc?](pubapis_markdown.html#rst_and_asciidoc) for more details around rST compared to Markdown.)

Sphinx can be used with the [Read the Docs](#readthedocs) platform and has a passionate fan base among those who use it. However, because it is specifically designed as a documentation tool, the community isn't as large as some of the other static site generators.

As of January 2018, [Staticgen.com](https://www.staticgen.com/) shows the number of stars, forks, and issues as follows:

<div style="padding: 10px;">
<img src="images/staticgenjekyll.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">
<img src="images/staticgenhugo.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">
<img src="images/staticgensphinx.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

Jekyll and Hugo are the most common static site generators. Between Hugo and Sphinx, there are 22 other static site generators (Hexo, GitBook, Docpad, Pelican, Wintersmith, and so forth), but I called out Sphinx here because of its popularity among documentation groups and for its integration with [Read the Docs](#readthedocs).

### Others

#### MkDocs {#mkdocs}

[MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is a static site generator based on Python and designed for documentation projects. Similar to Jekyll, with MkDocs you write in Markdown, store page navigation in YAML files, and can adjust the CSS and other code (or create your own theme). Notably, the MkDocs provides some themes that are more specific to documentation, such as the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). MkDocs also offers a theme (ReadtheDocs) that resembles the Read the Docs platform.

<a href="http://www.mkdocs.org/" class="noExtIcon"><img src="images/mkdocs.png"/></a>

Some [other themes](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes) are also available. MkDocs uses [Jinja templating](http://jinja.pocoo.org/), provides [template variables](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/custom-themes/#template-variables) for custom theming, and more.

Although there are many static site generators with similar features, MkDocs is one more specifically oriented towards documentation. For example, it does include search.

However, while it seems like orienting the platform towards documentation would be advantageous for tech writers, this approach might actually backfire, because it shrinks the community. The number of general web designers versus documentation designers is probably a ratio of 100:1. As such, MkDocs remains a small, niche platform that probably won't see much growth and long-term development beyond the original designer's needs.

This is the constant tradeoff with tools &mdash; the tools and platforms with the most community and usage aren't usually the doc tools. The doc tools have more features designed for tech writers, but they lack the momentum and depth of the more popular website building tools.

#### Slate {#slate}

 Slate is based on [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), a Ruby-based static site generator that is popular. [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) is popular theme for generating documentation following the three-column design made popular by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api).

<a href="https://github.com/lord/slate" class="noExtIcon"><img src="images/slatescreenshot.png" /></a>

With Slate, you write in Markdown, build from the command line, and deploy your site similar to other static site generators.

#### Miscellaneous

The list of other doc-oriented static site generator possibilities is quite extensive. Although probably not worth using due to the small community and limited platform, you might also explore [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/), [Dexy](http://www.dexy.it/), [Nanoc](https://nanoc.ws/), [API Documentation Platform](https://viasocket.com/docs), and [Apidoco](https://github.com/72pulses/apidoco). For more doc tools, see the [Generating Docs](https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs#generating-docs) list in [Beautiful Docs](https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs).

Right now there are probably many readers who are clenching their first and lowering their eyebrows in anger at the omission of their tool. *What about ... Docpad!!??? What about Nikola??!!*

Hey, there are *a lot* of tool options out there, and no doubt some readers may have found perfect match for their content and tool. If you feel strongly that I missed an essential tool here, feel free to [contact me](contact.html). (This page is already 5,000+ words long.)

Also, recognize that I'm only recommending what I perceive to be the most popular options. The developer tool landscape is diverse and constantly changing, and what may be relevant one day might be passÃ© the next. This is a difficult space to navigate, and selecting the right tool for your needs is a [tough question](pubapis_which_tool_to_choose.html). Unfortunately, the tool you choose can massively affect both your productivity and capability, so it tends to be an important choice.

## Hosting and deployment options

Static site generators handle content development, but not hosting and deployment. For this, you have another category of tools to consider.

Theoretically, you could publish a static website on any web server (e.g., AWS S3, Bluehost, and more). But continuous delivery hosting platforms do something more &mdash; they automatically build your output when you commit a change to a repo. These platforms often read content stored on GitHub, sync it to their platform, and initiate build and publishing pipelines with the content when they detect a change in a particular branch (such as gamma or prod).

Hosting and deployment platforms usually offer a number of additional features, such as SSL, CDNs, minification, authentication, backup/redundancy, and more. These platforms often integrate with specific static site generators as well (which is one reason I limited my earlier discussions to Jekyll, Hugo, and Sphinx).

### GitHub Pages {#github_pages}

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) provides a free hosting and deployment option for Jekyll projects. If you upload a Jekyll project to a GitHub repository, you can indicate that it's a Jekyll project in your GitHub repo's Settings, and GitHub will automatically build it when you commit to your repo. This feature &mdash; building Jekyll projects directly from your GitHub repo &mdash; is referred to as GitHub Pages.

In your GitHub repo, click **Settings** and scroll down to **GitHub Pages**. This is where you activate GitHub Pages for your project.

<figure><img src="images/githubpagesconfigurationsettings.png"/><figcaption>Every GitHub repository is potentially a Jekyll project that you can auto-build when you commit to it.</figcaption></figure>

The tight integration of Jekyll with GitHub makes for a compelling argument to use a Jekyll-GitHub solution. For the most part, GitHub is the dominant platform for open source projects. If you're already using GitHub, it makes sense to choose a static site generator that integrates into the same platform to build your docs.

Quite a few doc sites use GitHub and Jekyll. For example, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) uses it:

<a href="https://pages.github.com/" class="noExtIcon"><img src="images/githubpagesscreenshot.png"/></a>

GitHub Pages is free but does have some limitations in scope:

> GitHub Pages sites are subject to the following usage limits:
>
> * GitHub Pages source repositories have a recommended limit of 1GB .
> * Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB.
> * GitHub Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month.
> * GitHub Pages sites have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour.

Unlike with [Read the Docs](#readthedocs), GitHub Pages doesn't offer a commercial version that expands these limits. You can learn more about [GitHub Pages here](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/).

{: .note}
I build this site and [my blog](http://idratherbewriting.com) using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. They are actually separate Jekyll projects.

### CloudCannon {#cloudcannon}

Suppose you want to use Jekyll and GitHub, but you're frustrated by GitHub's limitations and you need a more robust platform for your Jekyll project. If so, [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/) is your solution. CloudCannon gives you a host of [additional features](https://cloudcannon.com/features/) that GitHub lacks, such as:

* Authentication of users
* Multiple environments for different branches
* Visual online interface for editing
* Jekyll plugins
* SSL
* Automatic minification, and more

The founders of CloudCannon are experts with Jekyll and have designed the platform specifically for Jekyll projects. They also created a [host of Jekyll tutorials](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/) to enrich developer knowledge.

### Read the Docs {#readthedocs}

Read the Docs is an online platform that can read Sphinx projects and automatically build an output. Read the Docs has both an open-source, free version &mdash; [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/) &mdash; and a commercial version &mdash; [readthedocs.com](https://readthedocs.com/). Read the Docs uses Sphinx and rST (or Markdown) as the documentation platform, and also contains web hooks to auto-build your output when you commit to a repo. The [Read the Docs documentation](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) shows a sample output.

<a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html" class="noExtIcon"><img src="images/readthedocsplatform.png" /></a>

Read the Docs describes itself as follows:

> Read the Docs hosts documentation, making it fully searchable and easy to find. You can import your docs using any major version control system, including Mercurial, Git, Subversion, and Bazaar. We support webhooks so your docs get built when you commit code. There's also support for versioning so you can build docs from tags and branches of your code in your repository.

Some key features include a robust sidebar with expand/collapse functionality, search, versioning, output to PDF and ePub, and more. Read the Docs is similar to GitHub Pages in that it offers continuous deployment when you commit to the repo. However, whereas GitHub Pages is based on Jekyll and Markdown, Read the Docs is based on Sphinx and [reStructuredText](pubapis_markdown.html#rst_and_asciidoc), which provides more documentation-specific features.

The Read the Docs platform was co-founded by [Eric Holscher](http://ericholscher.com/), the same co-founder of [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/). Write the Docs was originally intended as a conference for the Read the Docs community but evolved into a more general conference focused on technical communication for software projects. If you go to a Write the Docs conference, you'll find that sessions focus more on best practices for documentation rather than discussions about tools. (You can read my post, [Impressions from the Write the Docs Conference](http://idratherbewriting.com/2017/05/23/write-the-docs-and-the-battle-against-vendor-evil/)) or listen to this [Write the Docs podcast with the co-founders](http://idratherbewriting.com/2017/12/14/write-the-docs-founding-ideas-and-principles-podcast/) for more details.)

Read the Docs has an impressive number of users. The platform has more than 100,000 projects and receives millions of page views a month across these projects. It is one of the largest open-source documentation undertakings on the web, and continues to grow at an impressive rate. What's nice about Read the Docs is that it offers both a free model and a paid model, which allows you to level-up your project when your needs mature, but also doesn't lock you into a paid solution when you're not ready for it.

### Netlify {#netlify}

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a popular hosting and deployment service for static site projects. Unlike with other hosting platforms, Netlify works with almost any static site generator, not just with Jekyll or Sphinx.

Netlify works similar to GitHub Pages &mdash; when you push your content to the service, Netlify automatically builds and deploys your output (continuous delivery). However, Netlify offers this server hosting and deployment platform on a larger, more commercial scale than GitHub's free platform. With Netlify, you get a distributed content delivery network (CDN), infinite scalability, SSL, continuous delivery, a programmable API, CLI, and more.

The most impressive example of a Netlify-hosted site is [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/). Previously hosted on WordPress, Smashing Magazine made the switch to Netlify, with Hugo as the static site generator engine. See [Smashing Magazine just got 10x faster](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/03/16/smashing-magazine-just-got-10x-faster/) for details.

### Aerobatic {#aerobatic}

[Aerobatic](https://www.aerobatic.com/) is similar to Netlify in that it builds and publishes your static site. Aerobatic gives you a robust publishing engine that includes a CDN, SSL, continuous delivery, a deployment CLI, password protection, and more. Aerobatic can publish a number of static site generators, including Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, and more. Aerobatic says,

> Aerobatic is a specialized platform for efficient delivery of static webpages and website assets. We take care of the configuration details for you that provide the best balance of performance and maintainability. Stop fiddling with CDNs and web server configs and focus on coding great front-end experiences. &mdash; [Static website serving](https://www.aerobatic.com/docs/static-serving/)

## Static CMS platforms

Finally, there is a class of developer doc tools that combine both the authoring and the hosting/deployment in the same tool. These tools are often referred to as static content management systems (CMSs) because they provide a GUI layer over your static content.

In other words, they provide a WordPress.com-like experience for your content (giving you a user interface to browse your posts, pages, layouts, and other content). Updates you make are built automatically on the platform. But unlike Wordpress, the solution does not involve storing your content in a database and dynamically retrieving that content from the database when readers visit your page. In fact, many times you can store your content on GitHub, and the static CMS will read/pull it in a seamless way.

### Readme.io {#readmeio}

[Readme.io](http://readme.io) is an online static CMS for docs that offers one of the most robust, full-featured interfaces for developer docs available. Specifically, Readme.io includes features for displaying API documentation content. (If you consider how much time it requires to build, maintain, and troubleshoot your own website, it makes sense to consider an existing third-party platform where someone has already built all of this out already.)

To explore Readme.io:

1. Go to [readme.io](http://readme.io).
2. Click the **Sign Up** button in the upper-right corner and sign up for an account.
3. Click **+Add Project**. Then add a Project Name (e.g., Weather API), Subdomain (e.g., weather-api), and Project Logo. Then click **Create**.

   <img src="images/projectsettingsreadmeio.png" alt="Project Settings" />

4. Now check out the API doc configuration section. In the left sidebar, click **Reference Docs**, and then click **API**.

Although you can add your API information manually, you can also import an [OpenAPI specification file](pubapis_swagger_intro.html). You can experiment by choosing one from the [OpenAPI examples](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/tree/master/examples/v2.0/yaml), such as [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-expanded.json).

Readme.io provides a number of wizard-like screens to move you through documentation process, prompting you with forms to complete.

<img class="medium" src="images/readmeio_manual_api.png" style="border: 1px solid #dedede;" />

Overall, Readme.io provides a robust GUI for creating API documentation in a way that is more extensive and well-designed than virtually any other platform available. The output includes an interactive, try-it-out experience with endpoints:

<img class="medium" src="images/readmeiotryitout.png" style="border: 1px solid #dedede;" />

The experience is similar to Swagger in that the response appears directly in the documentation. This API Explorer gives you a sense of the data returned by the API.

(You don't have to describe your API through the OpenAPI specification in order to get interactive documentation. But if you don't, your doc will be tied to the Readme.io platform. Some export options are available.)

Additionally, if a paid cloud location for your docs isn't an option, the Readme platform may pose challenges. There isn't any content re-use functionality (currently), so if you have multiple outputs for your documentation that you're single sourcing, Readme.io may not be for you.

Even so, the output is sharp and the talent behind this site is top-notch. The platform is constantly growing with new features, and there are many high-profile companies with their docs on Readme.

Here are a few sample API doc sites built with Readme.io:

* [Validic](https://docs.validic.com/docs/getting-started)
* [Box API](https://developer.box.com/docs)
* [Coinbase API](https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2#introduction)

### Forestry.io {#forestry}

[Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) is similar to CloudCannon in that it offers online hosting for Jekyll projects, but it also provides hosting for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (another popular static site generator, with faster build times than Jekyll), and for Git. Forestry's emphasis is on providing an online CMS interface for static site generators.

The CMS interface gives you a WordPress-like GUI for seeing and managing your content. The idea is that most static site generators ostracize less technical users by forcing them into the code. (For example, when I write a post in Jekyll, usually others who look over my shoulder think I'm actually programming, even though I'm just writing posts in Markdown.) The CMS removes this by making the experience much more user friendly to non-technical people while also still leveraging the openness and flexibility of the static site generator platform.

Unlike CloudCannon, Forestry also offers an on-premise enterprise installation so you can host and manage the entire platform behind your company's firewall.

### Netlify CMS {#netlifycms}

[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) is similar to Forestry in its offering of a content management system for static site generator platform. But rather than limiting the static site generators you can use, it provides a more open platform that integrates with any static site generator. Netlify CMS's key value is in simplifying the content development experience for less technical users.

Writers and editors can easily manage content from draft to review to publish across any number of custom content types.</figcaption></figure>

The content can be stored in GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Netlify CMS provides a CMS layer over your project using a React-based wrapper.

Netlify CMS also integrates with [Netlify](#netlify), which is a popular hosting and deployment service for static site projects.
