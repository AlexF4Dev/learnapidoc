API documentation often follows a docs-as-code workflow, where the tools to author and publish documentation align closely with the same tools developer use to write code. This involves using lightweight formats such as Markdown, collaborating with Git or other version control, building your doc site with a static site generator, and deploying it through a continuous build model, where the build happens on the server when you push to a particular branch.
