Undoubtedly, Silicon Valley (the San Francisco Bay area in California) is where most API documentation jobs are located. However, you will also find API documentation jobs for technical writers in other tech hub cities, such as Seattle, New York, Portland, Boston, Dallas, Atlanta, Austin, Phoenix, and more. As far as statistics or percentages of API tech writing jobs by city, I don't believe that research has been done.

However, there's a great way to gauge how many technical writing jobs a city provides. I did a test a while back. Given the high cost of housing in San Jose, I wanted to keep an eye out for other potential job locations. I went to [indeed.com](http://indeed.com) and set up a job alert for "technical writer" in Portland, Seattle, and San Jose (the last acting as a benchmark).

Indeed will send you a daily job alert whenever there are new jobs in that area. Over a period of time, you can consistently see how many new tech writing jobs are popping up in a city. Without question, there were about 3-4 times more technical writing jobs appearing in San Jose than Portland, and a 2-3 times more than in Seattle.

I didn't run comparisons for more cities, nor did I add "API" into the job description. I'm willing to bet that API technical writing jobs will always be a fraction of normal technical writing jobs (maybe 15%?).

Your best option might be to select a few cities where you might like to live, set up some job alerts on Indeed.com for those areas, and then monitor the frequency of jobs there over the next month.

Another resource for technical writing jobs you might find helpful is the [STC Salary Database](https://www.stc.org/salary-database/). You have to be an STC member to download it (otherwise there's a fee). 

But overall, where are the tech jobs, especially for API docs? As far as I know, there's no research specifically focusing on API tech writer jobs, so we have to triangulate a bit.

According to the STC Salary Database (which is based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics data), the "10 largest metro areas by employment of tech writers" are as follows:

1.  New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA
2.  Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA
3.  Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI
4.  San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA
5.  Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI
6.  Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX
7.  Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, MD
8.  Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO
9.  Phoenix-Mesa-Scottscale, AZ
10. San Diego-Carlsbad, CA

A lot of the employment data focuses on metropolitan statistical areas. To gather some quick data, I put together a quick search on Indeed.com for the term [API](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=API&l=California) by state, another search for [technical writer](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=technical+writer&l=California) by state, and then listed the employment of technical writers by state as indicated by the 2016 STC Salary Database (which was the latest version). My searches on Indeed.com were done on August 12, 2018.

Granted, whether searches for these terms yields meaningful results is suspect, which is why I also list the more scientific information from the Salary Database. Here's the data:

In general, California, Texas, New York, Washington, Virginia, and Massachusetts are hot areas for jobs. If "API" is a more common term, I'm guessing that more technical writer jobs will involve working with APIs in those areas. The fact that the occurrences of "API" also roughly map to the employment numbers for the state suggests that it's a decent indicator.

By and large, California (specifically Silicon Valley) continues to be the hub for API technical writer jobs. However, California has a number of drawbacks, mainly that to live in Silicon Valley, you need the dual income of two working professionals to survive financially. For more thoughts on API tech writer jobs in Silicon Valley, see [Do you have to relocate to an urban tech hub to find a technical writing job?](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/04/27/tech-dystopia-and-where-the-tech-comm-jobs-are/).

Tech companies will continue to grow and expand outside of Silicon Valley. There's not enough space in Silicon Valley, and the number of engineers gets fewer and fewer as companies grow. Still, if you want to find work, target these popular areas. If you want to perhaps start a farm or ranch, move to Wyoming.
