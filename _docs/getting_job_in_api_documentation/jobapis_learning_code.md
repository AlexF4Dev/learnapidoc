With developer documentation roles, some level of coding is required. But you don't need to know as much as developers, and acquiring that deep technical knowledge will usually cost you expertise in other areas.

When faced with these multi-language documentation challenges, hiring managers often search for technical writers who are former programmers to do the tasks. There are a good number of technical writers who were once programmers, and they can command more respect and competition for these developer documentation jobs.

But even developers will not know more than a few languages. Finding a technical writer who commands a high degree of English language fluency in addition to possessing a deep technical knowledge of Java, Python, C++, .NET, Ruby, and more is like finding a unicorn. (In other words, these technical writers don't really exist.)

If you find one of these technical writers, the person is likely making a small fortune in contracting rates and has a near limitless choice of jobs. Companies often list knowledge of multiple programming languages as a requirement, but they realize they'll never find a candidate who is both a William Shakespeare and a Steve Wozniak.

Why does this hybrid individual not exist? In part, it's because the more a person enters into the worldview of computer programming, the more they begin thinking in computer terms and processes. Computers by definition are non-human. The more you develop code, the more your brain's language starts thinking and expressing itself with these non-human, computer-driven gears. Ultimately, you begin communicating less and less to humans using regular speech and fall more into the non-human, mechanical lingo. (I explored this concept more in [Reducing the complexity of technical language](https://idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-complexity/reducing-the-complexity-of-technical-language.html).)

This is both good and bad &mdash; good because other engineers in the same mindset may better understand you, but bad because anyone who doesn't inhabit that perspective and embrace the terminology already will be somewhat lost.

Remember that the terminology and model will vary from one language and platform to the next. One user may speak fluently in Ruby, but that language may not connect with somebody who is a .NET developer. Consequently, speaking "geek" can both connect with some developers and backfire with other developers.

## Writers who learned programming versus programmers who learned writing

Overall, there's some disagreement about whether it's better to have someone who is primarily a writer who learned programming versus someone who is a programmer who learned writing. In [Enough to Be Dangerous: The Joy of Bad Python](http://hackwrite.com/posts/enough-to-be-dangerous/), Adam Wood argues that tech writers don't need to be expert coders, on par with developers. Learning to code badly (such as is usually the case with writers who learn to code) is often enough to perform the tasks needed for documentation. As such, he aligns more with the camp of writers who learned programming.

Wood writes:

> You already know how hard it is to go from zero (or even 1) to actually-qualified developer. And you've met too many not-actually-qualified developers to have any interest in that path.
> So how do you get started?
> By deciding you are not ever going to write any application code. You are not going to be a developer. You are not even going to be a "coder."
> You are going to be a technical writer with bad coding skills. ([Enough to Be Dangerous: The Joy of Bad Python](http://hackwrite.com/posts/enough-to-be-dangerous/))

Wood says tech writers who are learning to code often underestimate the degree of difficulty in learning code. To reach developer proficiency with production-ready code, tech writers will need to sink much more time than they feasibly can. As such, tech writers shouldn't aspire to the same level as a developer. Instead, they should be content to develop minimal coding ability, or "enough to be dangerous."

James Rhea, in response to my post on [Generalist versus Specialist](https://idratherbewriting.com/2016/12/20/changing-roles-of-technical-writers/), also says that "adequate" technical knowledge is usually enough to get the job done, and acquiring deeper technical knowledge has somewhat diminishing returns, since it means other aspects of documentation will likely be neglected. Rhea writes:

> I wouldn't aim for deep technical knowledge. I would aim for adequate technical knowledge, recognizing that what constitutes adequacy may vary by project, and that technical knowledge ought to grow over time due to immersion in the documentation and exposure to the technology and the industry.
>
> I speculate that the need for writers to have deep technical knowledge diminishes as Tech Comm teams grow in size and as other skills become more important than they are for smaller Tech Comm teams. I'm not claiming that deep technical knowledge is useless. I'm suggesting that (to frame it negatively) neglecting deep technical knowledge has less severe consequences than neglecting content curation, doc tool set, or workflow considerations. ([Adding Value as a Technical Writer](https://withintheordinary.wordpress.com/2016/12/21/adding-value-as-a-technical-writer/))

In other words, if you spend excessive amounts of time learning to code, at the expense of tending to other documentation tasks such as shaping information architecture, analyzing user metrics, overseeing translation workflows, developing user personas, ensuring clear navigation, and more, your doc's technical content might improve a bit, but the overall doc site will go downhill.

Additionally, while engineers can fill in the deep technical knowledge needed, no one will provide the tech comm tasks in place of a tech writer. As evidence, just look at any corporate wiki. Corporate wikis are prime examples of what happens when engineers (or other non-tech writers) publish documentation. Pages may be rich with technical detail, but the degree of ROT (redundant, outdated, trivial content) gets compounded, navigation suffers, clarity gets muddled, and no one can find anything.

{% include random_ad2.html %}

Anyone who has a wiki at their company usually has a similar experience. Because no one really cares about internal wikis, companies let them degenerate into content junkyards. Almost every time I dive deep into my company's wiki, I encounter mountains of poorly written pages, abandoned content, impossible to navigate spaces, and other issues. It's a completely hit-and-miss, frustrating experience. The same would happen if we focused only on programming and other technical details at the expense of other tech comm aspects.

In contrast to Wood and Rhea, [James Neiman](http://drjamesneiman.com/), an experienced API technical writer, says that tech writers need engineering backgrounds, such as a computer science degree or previous experience as an engineer, to excel in API documentation roles.

Neiman says tech writers often need to look over a developer's shoulder, watching the developer code, or listen to an engineer's brief 15-minute explanation, and then return to their desks to create the documentation.

Neiman also says you may need to take the code examples in Java and produce equivalent samples in another language, such as C++, all on your own. In Neiman's view, API technical writers need more technical depth to excel than Wood and Rhea suggest.

James Neiman and [Andrew Davis](http://www.synergistech.com/) (a recruiter for API tech writers in the Bay area) recently gave a presentation titled [Finding the right API Technical Writer](https://youtu.be/lmNHBg20ql0?t=1314) at an API conference in London last October. Their presentation format includes a Q&A between Andrew and James.

Scrub to around the 22-minute mark for the relevant part:

Here's a transcription of the relevant exchange:

> **Andrew**: What is essential to your relationships with each new client?
>
> **James**: Being part of the product team, that communication within the team so that I know what is changing (and I expect things to change very rapidly, especially in a disordered environment where people are trying to stand up a product). I also need to earn and retain trust.
>
> Why should I say that? I'm going to be sitting with an engineering team. I'm going to need them to let me into their source code and let me modify their source code comments. I'm going to need to be able to pick an engineer's brain for fifteen minutes and fifteen minutes only &mdash; and get meaningful information out of that interview so that I can go and produce the documentation they need and get it right the first time. If I don't get it right the first time, I've wasted the engineer's time and I've wasted the company's money.
>
> **Andrew**: Can a tech writer without a development background write great API doc?
>
> **James**: Absolutely not. There is no way that a busy engineering team has time to train a person without a computer science degree. That's just the reality of it. Engineers at best can speak to you in some version of English, which may or may not be their native language. They don't have a lot of time, and they expect you to finish their thoughts for them. That means that you need to be able to sit next to them and look at how they're coding. And be able to replicate that and extend it and even create examples.
>
> They may say, "Here's an example. You can extend it, add on these other APIs, work out this use case for us. We haven't had time to finish this." They can say, "Well, let me show you how this works in Objective C; we also support this on Java. Can you create something similar on Java?"
>
> If you don't have that kind of development background, it's unrealistic that you could expect to train, for example, somebody with a masters degree in English and very intelligent person but otherwise not technical, to do such a thing.

Clearly, Neiman argues for a higher level of coding proficiency than Wood or Rhea. The level of coding knowledge required no doubt depends on the position, environment, and expectations at your company. If you're in a situation where the code is over your head, developers may send you chunks of code to add to the documentation.

Without the technical acumen to fully understand, test, and integrate the code in meaningful ways, you will be at the mercy of engineers and their terse explanations or cryptic inline comments. Your role will be reduced to being an editor/publisher instead of a writer.

{% include random_ad.html %}

Neiman says in one company, he tested out the code from engineers and found that much of the code relied on programs, utilities, or other configurations already set up on the developers' computers. As such, the engineers were blind to the initial setup requirements that users would need to properly run the code. Neiman says this is one danger of simply copying and pasting the code from engineers into documentation. While it may work on the developer's machine, it will often fail for users.

The more technical you are, the more powerful of a role you can play in shaping the information. Neiman is a former engineer and says that during his career, he has probably worked with 20-25 different programming languages. Being able to learn a new language quickly and get up to speed is a key characteristic of his tech comm consulting success, he says.

## Wide, not deep understanding of programming

Although you might have client implementations in a variety of programming languages at your company, the implementations will be brief. The core documentation needed will most likely be for the REST API, and then you will have a variety of reference implementations or demo apps in these other languages.

You don't need to have deep technical knowledge of each of the platforms to document them. You're probably just scratching the surface with each of them. As such, your knowledge of programming languages has to be more wide than deep. It will probably be helpful to have a grounding in fundamental programming concepts, and a familiarity across a smattering of languages instead of in-depth technical knowledge of just one language.

Having broad technical knowledge of multiple programming languages isn't really easy to pull off, though. As soon as you throw yourself into learning one language, the concepts will likely start blending together.

And unless you're immersed in the language on a regular basis, the details may never fully sink in. You'll be like Sisyphus, forever rolling a boulder up a hill (learning a programming language), only to have the boulder roll back down (forgetting what you learned) the following month.

Undoubtedly, technical writers are at a disadvantage when it comes to learning programming. Full immersion is the only way to become fluent in a language, whether referring to programming languages or spoken languages like Spanish. I studied Spanish for 3 years in high school, but it wasn't until I lived in Venezuela and interacted with locals for 6 months continuously speaking Spanish that the language finally clicked for me.

To get fully immersed, you might consider diving deep into one core programming language (like Java) and only briefly playing around in other languages (like Python, C++, .NET, Ruby, Objective C, and JavaScript).

Of course, you'll need to find a lot of time for this as well. Don't expect to have much time on the job for actually learning a programming language. It's best if you can make learning programming one of your "hobbies."

## Not an easy problem to solve

The diversity and complexity of programming languages is not an easy problem to solve. To be a successful API technical writer, you'll likely need to incorporate at least a regular regiment of programming study.

Fortunately, there are many helpful resources (my favorite being [Safari Books Online](http://www.safaribooksonline.com/)). If you can work in a couple of hours a day, you'll be surprised at the progress you can make.

Some of the principles that are fundamental to programming, like variables, loops, and try-catch statements, will begin to feel second nature, since these techniques are common across almost all programming languages. You'll also be equipped with a confidence that you can learn what you need to learn on your own (this is the hallmark of a good education).

But in discussions with hiring managers looking to fill six-month contracts for technical writers already familiar with their programming environment, it will be a hard sell to persuade the manager that "you can learn anything."

The truth is that you can learn anything, but it may take a long time to do so. It can take years to learn Java programming, and you'll never get the kind of project experience that would give you the understanding that a developer possesses.

## Strategies to get by

Suppose you find yourself deep in APIs that require you to know a lot more technical detail than you currently do (despite your programs of study to learn more)? How can you get by without a deeper knowledge of programming?

When you work in developer documentation environments, one strategy is to interview engineers about what's going on in the code, and then try your best to describe the actions in as clear speech as possible. You can always fall back on the idea that for those users who need Python, the Python code should look somewhat familiar to them. Well-written code should be, in some sense, self-descriptive in what it's doing. Unless there's something odd or non-standard in the approach, engineers fluent in code should be able to get a sense of how the code works.

In your documentation, you'll need to focus on the higher level information, the "why" behind the approach, the highlighting of any non-standard techniques, and the general strategy behind the code. You can get this *why* by asking developers for the information. The details of *what* will either be apparent in the code or can be minimized. (See [Code samples and tutorials](docapis_codesamples_bestpractices.html) for details.)

Just remember that even though someone is a developer, it doesn't mean he or she is an expert with all code. For example, the developer may be a Java programmer who knows just enough iOS to implement something on iOS, but for more detailed knowledge, the developer may be depending on code samples in documentation. Conversely, a developer who has real expertise in iOS might be winging it in Java-land and relying on your documentation to pull off a basic implementation.

More detail in the documentation is always welcome, but you have to use a progressive-disclosure approach so that expert users aren't bogged down with novice-level detail; at the same time, you have to make this additional detail available for those who need it. Expandable sections, additional pages, or other ways of grouping the more basic detail (if you can provide it) might be a good approach.

There's a reason developer documentation jobs pay more &mdash; the job involves a lot more difficulty and challenges, in addition to technical expertise. At the same time, it's just these challenges that make the job more interesting and rewarding.

## Techniques for learning code

The difficulty of learning programming is probably the most strenuous aspect of API documentation. How much programming do you need to know? How much time do you spend learning to code? How much priority should you spend on it?

For example, do you dedicate 2 hours a day to simply learning to code in the particular language of the product you're documenting? Should you carve this time out of your employer's time, or your own, or both? How do you get other doc work done, given that meetings and miscellaneous tasks usually eat up another 2 hours of work time? What strategies should you implement to actually learn code in a way that sticks? What if what you're learning has little connection or relevance with the code you're documenting?

In a post called [Strategies for learning technology -- podcast recommendation and a poll](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/08/10/how-much-time-devoted-to-learning-tech-is-needed/), I linked to a podcast with [Amruta Ranade on Learning New Technology](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/uah-technical-writing/10minute-tech-comm/e/supersized-holiday-spectacular-41636141) and then polled readers to learn a little about their tech learning habits. In their [responses](https://www.questionpro.com/t/PEGKEZcj57), most indicated that they *should* spend 30-60 min. each day learning technology, but most spend between 0-20 min doing so. To learn, they use general Google searches. They mostly devote this time to learning tech at work, though some split the time between work at home.

Personally, I think spending 20 min. a day is woefully inadequate to keep up with the knowledge needs. 60 minutes is more appropriate, but really, if you want to make progress, you'll need about twice that time. Finding 1-2 hours of time at work to learn it is unlikely. I always feel like I'm not getting enough done, like learning tech is a tangent to the immediate task at hand. And the information I need to document the current topic is usually too advanced to be practical to absorb at the start. I have to ramp up through the foundational topics first.

There are a lot of questions about just how to learn code, and I don't have all the answers. But here's what I know:

*  Developer documentation requires familiarity with code.
*  You have to understand explanations from engineers, including the terms used.
*  You should be able to test code from engineers.
*  Learning code will require a constant effort.
*  Learning to code badly may be enough to get by.
*  To thrive in an API documentation career, you have to incorporate a regiment of continual technology learning.

## It's okay to be a bad coder

Technical writers will likely be generalists with the code, not really good at developing it themselves but knowing enough to get by, often getting code samples from engineers and explaining the basic functions of the code at a high level.

Some might consider the tech writer's bad coding ability and superficial knowledge somewhat disappointing. After all, if you want to excel in your career, usually this means mastering something in a thorough way.

It might seem depressing to realize that your coding knowledge will usually be kindergartner-like in comparison to developers. This positions tech writers more like second-class citizens in the corporation &mdash; in a university setting, it's the equivalent of having an associates degree where others have PhDs.

However, I take consolation in the fact that my job is not to code but rather to create awesome *documentation*. Creating awesome documentation isn't just about knowing code. There are a hundred other details that factor into the creation of good documentation. As long as you set your goals on creating great documentation, not just on learning to code, you won't feel entirely disappointed in being a bad coder.

This direction doesn't address all the issues around learning programming, but it helps me remember that at the end of the day, my job involves documentation, not just knowledge of code.
