After completing the [API reference tutorial](docapis_api_reference_tutorial_overview.html), you're ready to start an activity that gives you more experience in creating and editing API reference documentation. In this activity, you'll either critique or create your own API reference topic for the open-source API project you [identified earlier](docapis_find_open_source_project.html).

## Create or fix an API reference documentation topic

This part of the activity might be challenging, but here is where you'll start building some examples for your portfolio.

1.  In the same project as before, identify one of the API reference topics that needs help. (If the API has a new reference endpoint to document, focus on this endpoint.)
2.  Edit the topic to improve it. (If it's a new endpoint, write the documentation for it.)
6.  Create a [pull request](pubapis_github_pull_requests.html) and contribute your edits to the project.

## Next steps

Now that you've had your head buried in API reference documentation, it's time to dive into testing. As you work with API endpoints and other code, you'll need to test these endpoints yourself, both to gather and verify the information in your documentation. Testing isn't always straightforward, so I devote an entire section to this topic. Continue to [Overview to testing your docs](testingdocs_overview.html).
