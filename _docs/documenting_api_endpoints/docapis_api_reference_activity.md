After completing the [API reference tutorial](docapis_api_reference_tutorial_overview.html), you're ready to start an activity that gives you more experience in creating and editing API reference documentation. In this activity, you'll evaluating some API reference topics to identify issues.

## Create or fix an API reference documentation topic

This part of the activity might be challenging, but here is where you'll start building some examples for your portfolio.

1.  In the same project as before, identify one of the API reference topics that needs help. (If the API has a new reference endpoint to document, focus on this endpoint.)
2.  Edit the topic to improve it. (If it's a new endpoint, write the documentation for it.)
6.  Create a [pull request](pubapis_github_pull_requests.html) and contribute your edits to the project.

## Next steps

Now that you understand the essential sections to cover in documenting API endpoints, let's look at standardized approaches for describing these sections, primarily with the [OpenAPI specification and Swagger](pubapis_rest_specification_formats.html). The OpenAPI standard will help make sure you cover all the necessary details in these sections, and it will present the information to users in a way that users have become accustomed to.
