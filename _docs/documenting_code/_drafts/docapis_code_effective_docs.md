## Code documentation that is most effective

 *What kind of code samples are most effective?*

 *code needs to be as simple as possible without interfering with other elements such as presentation.*

 . *Isn’t there a tradeoff with examples, where if you include too many, it can be more onerous to maintain and update?*

13. *Do you do a linear line by line walk through of code? Or do you jump around to the different parts as they make sense?*

. *Why aren’t visuals more helpful with program docs? Why don’t visuals reduce the complexity here? There is a whole genre of code diagramming*
