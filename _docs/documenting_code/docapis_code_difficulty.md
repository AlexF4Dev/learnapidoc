## Why code is difficult to document
- *Code breaks the step by step flow of tasks in terms of its approach.  Code can be non-linear*
- presumably the code samples are the most important aspect of documentation, so why are they so minimized in docs?* *It’s probably because so few people understand how to write about them, how to document them. it’s like another language.*
- You really need to be a developer. This is not something that technical writers typically document.*

Why have coding techniques been studied so little if they are so important? Not sure. It’s like they’re new territory and maybe there’s not a ton to say about them?*

 *Does step by step task formatting kind of break down with code? Because the steps are not so small such as click this or that. It’s more like do this task, and here’s some code, and here’s an explanation of how it works.*

- it's hard to reference the code. you might want to refer to different parts of the code during conceptual explanations.  It could be useful to have some line numbers to reference this, but it might not be so wise to count on this for maintainability.

 *Are code samples like tasks? Could you say that all code is somewhat action-oriented to some extent. There is something you are to do here. Yeah, I buy that.*

  *Are code samples what developers really want? Yeah. It’s basically the copy and paste shortcut.*

  *I think you’re coming to conclude that code samples haven’t received the importance they should have, and that this is going to be a super helpful and timely topic.*

8. *Is code poetry? Is it beautiful? In what ways might that influence how you care for it and present it?*

 *“Most program documentation is written by developers for*
*developers.” From Connecting Technical Communicators with Developers. Does this put tech writers at a disadvantage from the start? Is this why we do so horribly at this job? Or is this outsiderness what makes us good?*

*If code samples are one of the most important features of developer docs, then surely commentary and discussion of said code samples must be equally important, right?
