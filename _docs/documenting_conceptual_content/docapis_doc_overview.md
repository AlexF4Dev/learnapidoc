The API overview explains what you can do with the API, including the high-level business goals, the market needs or pain points it solves, who the API is for, and other introductory information. Although a seemingly simple page, the overview can confusingly overlap into marketing domains, present redundancies with readme's, and present challenges with a more diverse audience than the rest of your technical docs.

## Purpose of the API overview

Too often with API documentation, the documentation gets quickly mired in technical details without ever explaining clearly what the API is used for. Don't lose sight of the overall purpose and business goals of your API by getting lost in the endpoints.

The API overview grounds users with a high-level understanding of the system. This high-level understanding is critical in order to grasp the system as a whole. It allows the details to fit into a broader conceptual framework.

To get an idea of what the API is about, users start at a high-level, getting a gist of what something is about from the title and description, and then work their way into more details. This overview provides this initial orientation for the user.

In the overview, list some common business scenarios in which the API might be useful. These scenarios will give users the context they need to evaluate whether the API is relevant to their needs.

Keep in mind that there are thousands of APIs. If people are browsing your API, their first and most pressing question is, what information does it return? Is this information relevant and useful to my needs?

## Explain the market problems your API solves

In [The Top 20 Reasons Startups Fail](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/), one of the main reasons startups fail is their inability to solve a market problem. The authors explain:

> Startups fail when they are not solving a market problem. We were not solving a large enough problem that we could universally serve with a scalable solution. We had great technology, great data on shopping behavior, great reputation as a thought leader, great expertise, great advisors, etc, but what we didnâ€™t have was technology or business model that solved a pain point in a scalable way. (*CB Insights*)

This overview focuses in on the market problem that the API solves. If your API fails, it's likely because it's not solving a market problem.

The API overview usually appears on the homepage of the API. The homepage (the start of your docs) is a good place to put this overview because in this overview you also define your audience. Understanding your audience helps you orient the content in your API documentation appropriately.

## Product overview vs overviews (plural)

A developer portal usually has documentation for many different products, not just one. Each product will have its own product overview page, and all of these pages might be linked under a larger developer portal overview that is less product specific.

Even a large product might have overviews for each of the large features. The overview is just a term for the opening page of a product, the landing page or starting page.

## Audience dimensions

One added dimension with product overviews is the expanded audience. Product overviews aren't just read by your target users, i.e., usually engineers. Product overviews are frequently read by product managers, executives, and other decision makers who are trying to decide whether to purchase or move forward with the product. These decision-makers might be trying to size up the complexity of integration, how many person hours the effort will consume.

For example, a high-level exec might be trying to decide if implementing your product will require one week integration effort by a single developer or a team of 50 developers working heads-down for six months. The product overview should give some indication of the development effort.

Also, the high-level executive will be less interested in the technical details and more comfortable with more conceptual and bigger picture content. An architectural diagram that describes how the product works at a high level is appropriate, but probably save the excruciating technical details for the inner pages of the documentation.

## Overlap with marketing

Another interesting facet of product overview pages is their overlap with marketing content. In many organizations, there is a "developer marketing" group that handles product overviews that cover this more high-level overview of the product. For example, if you browse the AWS Lambda documentation, you'll find that a higher-level product overview appears before the actual documentation.

<a class='noCrossRef' href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"><img style="border: 1px solid #dedede" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/api/awslambdaproducthomepage.png" alt="AWS Lambda product homepage" /></a>

This marketing layer covers these topics: Overview, Features, Pricing, Getting Started, Resources, FAQs, and Partners. The [Lambda documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) is presented in another site:

<a class='noCrossRef'  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html"><img style="border: 1px solid #dedede"  src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/api/awslambdadochomepage.png" alt="Lambda documentation homepage" /></a>

The documentation product overview repeats some of the same content as the product overview. The documentation product overview addresses these questions:

* When should I use AWS Lambda?
* Are you a first-time user of AWS Lambda?

Typically, developer marketing teams write the marketing product overview, while developer documentation teams write the documentation product overview. But as you can see, this is an area where content overlaps and where some coordination across teams becomes essential. Suppose the doc team for Lambda wanted to emphasize certain points that the marketing team did not &mdash; it would create a confusing transition between the two sets of content. But even with differences, the idea is that business decision makers read the marketing content, while engineers read the documentation content.

Your organization might have multiple teams writing content like this, or you might be tasked with creating both the higher-level marketing layer and the documentation yourself. In some ways, having a single team handle both types of content might lead to a more streamlined content experience because then you might not have two different sites covering your product.

It might seem logical to share content between these two groups, but usually marketing has a different system for managing and publishing content than the documentation teams. These systems rarely share content, and even if they did, the marketing versions might prefer to be more condensed and cover other features such as pricing, which is rarely an area documentation ventures into.

What strategies should you employ when you're faced with writing a product overview when a product marketing team has their own product overview on a separate site? Consider doing the following:

* Find out who the marketing group is and what messaging they are focusing on for the product.
* Create a condensed version of the marketing overview content, and point users to the marketing overview for more details. You don't want to duplicate all the content because invariably, docs will go out of date as the other content evolves (not to mention the confusion of presenting two sets of overviews to users).

One key style detail in documentation is to strip out any mention of the word "easy" or "just," as in "the implementation is so easy, you just have to do X..." To sell a product, marketing invariably gravitates toward promises about ease of implementation. This is perhaps the hallmark of marketing content. As a technical writer, you not only have an obligation to be honest about implementation complexity, but you also recognize that what is easy for one user might be nearly insurmountable to another. Never say something is "easy" &mdash; you might qualify the degree of development effort based on the role. For example, for a seasoned engineer familiar with Java and who has been developing cloud-based apps for years, implementing this product will likely be straightforward and not require more than a week of integration effort. For someone new to cloud-based app development, there will be a much steeper learning curve and might require several months or more of preparation and learning to implement.

## Overlap with README's

Another challenge with product overviews is the overlap with README content. A README is typically an introductory overview file placed in a code repository such as GitHub. The README often has many elements of an overview present in a documentation overview that lives on a documentation site. If your documentation references a code repo, that code repo needs a README. But do you duplicate the same information in the README that you do with the documentation (and potentially a product marketing site as well)?

Hopefully not too much. The README might have a high-level summary and information on installation, configuration, and usage. But my feeling is that this information should be condensed from more detailed documentation. Many guides about README content assume that the README is the only documentation source for the code in the repo. As a professional technical writer, I rarely work on projects that are so small that the documentation can be handled by a single page that lives in a code repo. If that's all you need for your product, great. However, chances are the README is only a glimpse of many more pages of configuration, installation, and usage that live in a more robust documentation site.

However, the README has some elements that don't necessarily belong in regular documentation. Components specific to the code repo might be the following:

* Version information
* Code of conduct
* How to contribute
* Filing issues
* Pull requests
* License information
* Team/contributors

See [The Essential Sections for Better Documentation of Your README Project](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/articles/btc-readme-documentation-best-practices) by Thomas Parisot for a good guide about writing README content.

I admit that my preferences for what the README should contain might deviate from general recommendations from developers in this space. I am not a fan of duplicating the same information in the documentation into a README. If your documentation covers installation, configuration, implementation, usage, etc.., why duplicate this same information in a text file in a code repo? Instead, I prefer to provide brief summaries only in the README and point users to the main documentation for more details. For example, you could provide 1-2 sentences for each of these sections and point users back to your docs for details.

README's have the additional complication of being difficult to maintain. Unless you have rights to publish to the code repository, you might not be able to easily update the README content. If you're an engineer who is writing the code and docs at the same time, this likely isn't an issue. But in many organizations, technical writers are separate from engineering teams, and they usually don't publish code to GitHub repos. I've done this in the past, pushing out a sample app to a GitHub repo for an engineering team, moving the content through the organization's requirements and process to get it live. But I learned that the person who pushes content into a repo owns that content and all the filed issues, pull requests, and other responsibilities that come with repo management. I didn't want to be in that position &mdash; I wanted the engineers to own and maintain the code and control pushes to this space.

I share this experience only to reinforce that README files shouldn't contain so many doc details that the information begins to conflict or become outdated with your main documentation.

## Good Docs project template

If you're looking for more inspiration and guidance about overviews, see the [API overview template from the Good Docs project](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/templates/blob/master/api-overview/about-overview.md). They recommend similar sections as those I've been recommending here &mdash; establish who the docs are for, what problems the product solves, what market/industry the product is intended for.

In the body of the overview, the Good Docs team recommends covering the following questions:

> * What is it supposed to do? (What problem does it solve, and for whom?)
> * What exact capabilities are available to the user? What services does it offer?
> * What does it not do that developers should know about?
> * What are the typical use cases?
> * How does it work? (What do users need to know about architecture an * internal components?)
> * What dependencies does the developer need to know about before installing?
> * What technical requirements do readers need? Include development environment and licensing requirements.
> * What knowledge prerequisites does the developer need to know about before using the API?
> (see [The overview](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/templates/blob/master/api-overview/about-overview.md))

This is all good information to include.

## Sample structure of a product overview

I'm not sure if a more specific structure is worthwhile for an overview, as they likely vary too much from product to product. But here's the general flow that I like to follow:

- Overview of the product
- Who it's for
- Sample use cases
- Requirements to use the product
- High-level architecture
- List of components
- Development effort/scope
- Link to getting started tutorial

## Sample API overviews

Here are a few sample API overviews.

### SendGrid

{% include course_image.html url="https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/index.html" filename="sendgridoverview" ext_web="png" ext_print="png" alt="SendGrid API overview" caption="SendGrid API overview" %}

The Sendgrid overview starts with two key sections: "What is SendGrid?" and "Who is SendGrid for?" I like the straightforward approach. Even in the description of what SendGrid is, the authors don't assume everyone knows what an SMTP provider is, so they link out to more information. Overall, in about 10 seconds you can get an idea of what the SendGrid API is all about.

### Lyft

{% include course_image.html url="https://developer.lyft.com/docs/overview" filename="lyftapioverview" ext_web="png" ext_print="png" alt="Lyft API overview" caption="Lyft API overview" %}

Lyft's API overview starts in a similar way, with sections titled "What is Lyft?" and "Why Use Lyft as a Developer." Their homepage also provides information on access, rate limits and throttling, and testing. The Lyft authors also recognize that each tech domain has its own lingo, so they provide a [glossary](docapis_glossary_section.html) up front.

### IBM Watson Assistant

{% include course_image.html url="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/assistant?topic=assistant-index#index" filename="ibmcloudoverview" ext_web="png" ext_print="png" alt="IBM Watson Assistant overview" caption="IBM Watson Assistant overview" %}

IBM Watson Assistant starts off with a brief summary of the service, followed by a high-level diagram of the system and a summary about how to implement it. Including a diagram of your API gives users a good grounding about what to expect, such as the level of complexity and time it will take to incorporate the API.

## <i class="fa fa-user-circle"></i> Activity with API overviews

{% include image_ad_right.html %}

With the [open-source project you identified](docapis_find_open_source_project.html), identify the API overview. Then answer the following questions:

1. Does the documentation have an API overview?
2. Does the overview clarify who the API is for?
3. Does the overview indicate the market need or business problem the API solves?
4. What questions do you still have about the API after reading the overview?
5. How does the overview transition into a getting started tutorial or other first steps with the API?
