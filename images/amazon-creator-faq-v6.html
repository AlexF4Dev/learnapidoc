  <dt>Q: What is Amazon Creator?</dt>
  <dd>Amazon Creator is a tool to help content creators or owners <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-create-your-app">create apps</a> — standalone applications for watching content — for Fire TV. Amazon Creator uses the media in your YouTube channel or Media RSS feed to create a customized web app that you can style and then publish directly into the Amazon Appstore.</dd>
  <dt>Q: What monetization options do I have for my app?</dt>
  <dd>Monetization options for Amazon Creator apps are limited. You can’t charge users to download your app, nor can you use Amazon ad services, in-app purchasing, payment gateways, or links that point outside your app. However, Fire TV won’t block ads from your videos, so if your video host allows you to have ads on other platforms, Fire TV will allow the ads to appear on your videos. Note that (at least as of June 2017, when this FAQ was written) YouTube blocks ads from appearing on platforms that access videos through their APIs. Regardless of whether ads appear or not, views of your videos on Fire TV aren’t recorded by YouTube’s metrics (again, as of June 2017), so any view counts on Fire TV are irrelevant.</dd>
  <dt>Q: Where do I find my YouTube Username or Channel ID?</dt>
  <dd>You can find your YouTube Username or Channel ID when you log in to your YouTube account. The ID appears in the URL when you view your channel. See <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-youtube#getchannelid">Get Your YouTube Channel ID</a> for details.</dd>

<h2 id="editing-your-app">Editing Your App</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Q: How do I edit my app?</dt>
  <dd><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-preview-your-app">Editing an app</a> is done through a sidebar visual editor. To edit your app, click <strong>Manage Apps</strong> in the upper-right corner, then click the <strong>Edit</strong> button next to your app. Any changes to your app’s design are saved as a <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-preview-your-app#saveastheme">theme</a>. The last saved theme will be the currently active theme for the app.</dd>
  <dt>Q: My playlists aren’t appearing in the category navigation bar.</dt>
  <dd>If you’re using YouTube, the category navigation bar doesn’t show playlists by default. It shows <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3027787?hl=en">sections</a> in your YouTube channel. A section is an area within your channel that groups a specific type of content (e.g., a playlist). After you assign playlists to different sections in your YouTube channel, the category navigation bar in your app will show those playlists. See <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-youtube#groupvideosintoplaylists">Group Videos into Playlists in Your App’s Category Navigation Bar</a> for details. If you’re using MRSS, the category navigation bar populates based on the category tags in your feed items.</dd>
  <dt>Q: In the app preview, clicking options in the category navigation bar doesn’t work.</dt>
  <dd>You can’t use your mouse to interact with the web app elements in the browser preview. You have to click on the <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/firetv/amazoncreator/amazon-creator-directional-pad.png" target="\_blank">virtual remote</a>. For example, if you use your <em>mouse’s cursor</em> to click the category navigation bar, the nav bar won’t respond. Instead, to select an option from the category navigation bar, use the virtual remote — click the up arrow followed by the center button to see the items in the list. The center button expands or plays what you have selected with the arrow buttons. See the video in <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-preview-your-app">Preview Your App</a> for a demo.</dd>
  <dt>Q: How can I block some videos from appearing in my app?</dt>
  <dd>By default, all videos in your YouTube channel appear in your app. To prevent some videos from appearing in your app, you can block the videos by listing the video IDs you want to block. Go to <strong>Manage Apps</strong>, click <strong>Advanced</strong> in your app details, and see the <strong>Blocked Videos</strong> section. Alternatively, you can create additional channels (in your same YouTube account) and adjust the videos in the channel associated with your app. For details, see <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-youtube#createmultiplechannels">Create Multiple Channels in Your YouTube Account</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Q: How do I add custom pages or links in the category navigation menu?</dt>
  <dd>You cannot add custom links or pages in the category navigation bar. This menu shows any <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3027787?hl=en">sections</a> in your YouTube channel if you’re using YouTube, or it shows categories from your feed if you’re using an MRSS feed. The About page in this menu acknowledges the use of YouTube API services and provides links to terms and privacy policies. You can’t modify the About page. If you desire, you can hide the Latest item from the category navigation bar (but not the category navigation bar itself). (To hide the Latest item, go to <strong>Manage Apps</strong>, click <strong>Advanced</strong> in your app details, and see the <strong>Categories Navigation Bar Options</strong> section.)</dd>
  <dt>Q: My app’s logo looks distorted. How can I fix it?</dt>
  <dd>Amazon Creator allows you to upload a new logo when you <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-preview-your-app">edit your app</a>. Click <strong>Manage Apps</strong> in the upper-right corner, then click the <strong>Edit</strong> button next to your app. In the <strong>Logo</strong> section of the sidebar, click <strong>Choose a file</strong>. Amazon Creator maintains the aspect ratio of the image you upload. If the image is distorted, make sure the image you upload is 500 x 500px.</dd>
  <dt>Q: The text in the app is not legible. Can I change the color?</dt>
  <dd>Amazon Creator currently supports two font styles to make text more readable on different background colors. Look for the <strong>Font Theme</strong> dropdown menu in the visual editor sidebar when you’re editing your app. The two themes currently supported are “Light” and “Dark.” The font theme you select will apply to all the text in your app.</dd>
  <dt>Q: How do I save a color scheme?</dt>
  <dd>When you edit your app and make changes to the colors, images, or fonts, and then click <strong>Save</strong>, you’re prompted to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-preview-your-app#saveastheme">save your design changes as a theme</a>. You can save your current theme settings as either a new theme or overwrite an existing theme. After you save a theme, it will be automatically applied as the active theme of that app.</dd>
  <dt>Q: Can I save over a predefined theme?</dt>
  <dd>No, but you can modify a predefined theme and save it as a new theme.</dd>

<h2 id="testing-your-app">Testing Your App</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Q: How can I test my app on Fire TV before publishing?</dt>
  <dd>The easiest way to test your app before publishing is to search the Fire TV Appstore for the official “Amazon Creator Preview” app and install it on your Fire TV. After you <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-preview-your-app#amazoncreatorpreview">install and open Amazon Creator Preview</a>, it prompts you to add an app through a code. You can find this code by clicking <strong>Manage Apps</strong> (in Amazon Creator) — look for the “Amazon Creator Preview Code” in your app’s details. After you add your app in Amazon Creator Preview, press select on the logo to open the app and test its functionality.</dd>
  <dt>Q: How can I share my app with friends/colleagues/family before publishing?</dt>
  <dd>You can share your app with others before publishing in two ways. You can have your friends <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-preview-your-app#amazoncreatorpreview">use the “Amazon Creator Preview” Fire TV app</a> (see the previous question for details) and give them the Amazon Creator Preview Code. Alternatively, <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-preview-your-app#previewyourapp">copy and share the “Test URL”</a> from the <strong>Manage Apps</strong> page. Anyone who has the Test URL can preview your app in a browser.</dd>

<h2 id="publishing-your-app">Publishing Your App</h2>

  <dt>Q: I’m having trouble with my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.amazon.com%2Fap_login.html&amp;openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&amp;openid.assoc_handle=mas_dev_portal&amp;openid.mode=checkid_setup&amp;openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&amp;pageId=mas_dev_portal2&amp;openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&amp;language=en_US&amp;openid.pape.max_auth_age=1">Amazon developer account</a>. Can I still publish to the Amazon Appstore?</dt>
  <dd>It is better to resolve your Amazon developer account issues first and then publish your app to the Appstore. You might have to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/support/contact/contact-us">contact Amazon Developer Portal support team</a> to resolve your developer-account-related issues.</dd>
  <dt>Q: How soon after publishing to Appstore will my app be available?</dt>
  <dd>We review every app after submission. Time for an app to go live can vary depending on content or technical issues. We will notify you when there are any changes to your app’s status. You can also <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-publish-your-app#viewsubmissionstatus">check the status of your submission</a> on the <strong>Manage Apps</strong> page.</dd>
  <dt>Q: My app was denied by the Appstore. How can I fix it?</dt>
  <dd>You should have received an email from Amazon Appstore detailing the reason for your denial. You will need to resolve the reasons for which your app was denied and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-publish-your-app">re-publish the app</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Q: Amazon Creator says an API Key is required. Where do I find my API Key?</dt>
  <dd>You can get your API key from the Google Developer Console. See the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-youtube#getdevkey">tutorial here</a>. Or click the <strong>?</strong> link next to <strong>API Key</strong> on the <strong>Manage Apps</strong> page in Amazon Creator.</dd>
  <dt>Q: Can I change the look and feel of my app after it was published?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, you can update the look and feel of your app by going to <strong>Manage Apps</strong> and clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> button next to your app. After you finish, you can push your changes live (without having to republish to the Appstore and wait for approval).</dd>
  <dt>Q: How will my app be evaluated in the submission/approval process?</dt>
  <dd>Your app will probably not have any technical issues (unless options in the category navigation bar fail to load video content). Mostly, the Appstore team will evaluate your app based on whether your content conforms to Amazon Appstore’s content policy. Your content should avoid all of the following: offensive content, pornography, illegal activity, gambling with real currency, intellectual property infringement, privacy/publicity infringement, and country-specific restrictions. More details are available in the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/support/submitting-your-app/tech-docs/appstore-content-policy">Amazon Appstore Content Policy Requirements</a>. For examples of policy violations, see the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/support/submitting-your-app/tech-docs/appstore-content-policy#examples-of-amazon-appstore-content-policy-violations">Examples of Amazon Appstore Content Policy Violations</a> section.</dd>
  <dt>Q: Can I see stats and analytics about video playback/usage on YouTube from my Fire TV app?</dt>
  <dd>You can view only reports about the number of app downloads. You cannot view how many times certain videos were played or how many minutes of video users watched. To view your app’s metrics, log into the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/">Amazon Developer Console</a> and click <strong>Reporting</strong> in the top navigation bar. For details, see <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/amazon-creator-publish-your-app#viewmetrics">View Reports about App Downloads and Usage.</a> If you need more robust metrics, you might be able to get them through your online video host (Brightcove, Ooyala, Kaltura, or thePlatform). Note that (as of June 2017, when this FAQ was written) views of your video on Fire TV won’t be recorded in your YouTube video metrics. (For example, if you get 1,000 views of your YouTube videos on Fire TV and nowhere else, YouTube will show 0 views of your video in YouTube’s metrics.)</dd>
  <dt>Q: Can I manage my app through the Developer Portal?</dt>
  <dd>No, information flows one way only — updates you make in Amazon Creator flow into the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com">Developer Portal</a>, but any updates you make in the Developer Portal <em>do not</em> flow back into Amazon Creator. If you modify your app details (e.g., updating descriptions, images, or other metadata) from within the Developer Portal, your app in Amazon Creator will not reflect those changes. Updates you publish from Amazon Creator will always overwrite any changes you made in the Developer Portal.</dd>

  <dt>Q: How can I get support or help for my app?</dt>
  <dd>If your question is still not answered, we offer the following options:
